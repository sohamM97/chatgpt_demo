These operations should be made to run asynchronously to ensure that the user can continue working on the project while the operations are being carried out. To notify the user about the details of the triggered operations and its completion, we need to save the job details and notify the user about them. \\n\\nThe document covers details for the notification system.\\n\\nUse cases\\n\\nModel Build (NLU and KM)\\n\\nImport project\\n\\nExport project\\n\\nStart prediction engine\\n\\nSwitch prediction build\\n\\nUsers\\n\\nThe notifications shown will differ based on the user.\\n\\nSystem Admin\\n\\nSystem administrators can view all the jobs from the users under all the tenants.\\n\\nTenant Admin/Users\\n\\nTenant admins/users will only be shown the job details that were triggered by them. Going forward we may change this so that they can view all the job details triggered by any users within the same tenant.\\n\\nThe above two use cases will be provided by a single api based on the role of the user. Going forward, we need a mechanism to systematically show notifications in the frontend for the jobs to the users (one possible solution is using sockets).\\n\\nDatabase model\\n\\nThis section gives information about the database tables related to the notification system.\\n\\nJob Table\\n\\nJob (Captures information of a particular job)\\n\\nid\\n\\ntenant\\n\\ncreatedBy\\n\\ncreatedOn\\n\\nlastUpdateOn\\n\\noperation (possible values: ‘MODEL_BUILD_NLU’, ‘MODEL_BUILD_KM’, ‘IMPORT_PROJECT’, ‘EXPORT_PROJECT’, ‘START_PREDICTION_ENGINE’, ‘SWITCH_PREDICTION_BUILD’)\\n\\ndescription - varchar(256)\\n\\nstatus (possible values: ‘IN_PROGRESS’, ‘FAILED’, ‘COMPLETED’)\\n\\nlink (Link to the page showing the job outcome) - varchar(128)\\n\\ndownloadPath (only for file path for export project) - varchar(128)\\n\\nCreating Jobs\\n\\nUsing jobs for the user is a two-step process. In the first step, a job entry will be created once one of the use cases is triggered. The initial entry will indicate that the process has started. On completion of the process, for the second step, the job entry will be updated to indicate the completion of the process.\\n\\nFor example, for model import, when the model build is triggered, before we enter the asynchronous operation thread for importing, we create a job with appropriate user_id and tenant_id and the operation as IMPORT_PROJECT. Once the import is completed, we update the job with the completionTime and the pageLink for the imported project.\\n\\n\\nUsage\\n\\nModel Build (NLU)\\n\\nOn triggering model build for the NLU project, a new job is created, indicating that the process has started. There are 2 possible cases here:\\n\\nIf there is no model to be built: In this case, the job will be updated to indicate that there was nothing to be built.\\n\\nIf there is at least one model to be built: In this case, the job will be updated after completion of model building process to indicate that model building has been completed.\\n\\nCase                                   state        description                                                       link\\nModel build started                    IN_PROGRESS  Initializing model build for <version number> of <project name>.  null\\nModels sent to the worker to be built  IN_PROGRESS  Model build started for <version number> of <project name>.\\nNo models to be built                  COMPLETED    No models to be built for <version number> of <project name>.\\n                                                    <Individual model build category statuses>\\nModel building complete                COMPLETED    Model build completed for <version number> of <project name>.\\nModel build failed                     FAILURE      Model build failed for <version number> of <project name>.        null\\n                                                    <Reason for failure>\\n\\nModel Build (KM)\\n\\n<To be added>\\n\\nImport Project\\n\\nOn starting the import operation for a project, job with operation IMPORT_PROJECT will be created and when the import is completed, the job will be updated to show its completion and the link will contain the new project link.\\n\\nCase                      state        description                                                     link\\nImport project started    IN_PROGRESS  Project import for <project name> has started.                  null\\nImport project completed  COMPLETED    Project <project name> has been imported successfully.\\nImport project failed     FAILURE      Import failed for project <project name>. <Reason for failure>  null\\n\\nExport Project\\n\\nApi structure for export project is changed for making it asynchronous.

When the worker is started, model0 will be the first one to be trained and hence its start time will be set and status will be changed from INITIALIZING to IN_PROGRESS. Once the update call for model0 returns, its start time, end time and status will be updated according to the response received from the worker. At the same time, model1 will be the next to be trained, hence, its start time will be updated and status will be changed from INITIALIZING to IN_PROGRESS. Once the model1 worker response is received, its start time, end time and status will be updated and finally, the entire model build status will be updated along with the build time.\\n\\nChanging the model build entry structure such that model build entry is created only for the cases where at least one model needs to be built and after the data files are saved.', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Jobs.docx'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Move to Rasa 2.0\\n\\nCurrently, we are using Rasa 1.10 for building our NLU models and for predictions. However, the latest version is Rasa 2.0. Hence, we are shifting to an NLU engine which incorporates functionality from Rasa 2.0.\\n\\nTo be precise, we shall not use the full Rasa 2.0 python package itself, but a separated version of Rasa 2.0 consisting of only the code that is necessary for our purposes. Other functionality can be added on top of that as and when necessary.\\n\\nComponents\\n\\nIntents and Entities - Sentences on which NLU models have to be trained, called ‘utterances’, can be marked with -\\n\\nIntents - The goal/intention expressed by the complete utterance\\n\\nEntities - Individual objects present in the utterance. Every entity has a name and a value.\\n\\nFor example, the sentence ‘Book Rajdhani for 10 people’ has the intent ‘BookBlockReserve’, and the entities - value: ‘Rajdhani’, name: ‘ConferenceRoomName’;  and value: ‘10’, name: ‘Quantity_Unit’.\\n\\nEntity types - Entities defined in AELI Studio can have the following types - \\n\\nList - entities with a list of predefined values. \\n\\nE.g. - an entity of type list called Hardware_Peripheral can have predefined values like ‘keyboard’, ‘mouse’ etc. During prediction, if any of these words are present in an utterance, they will be marked as Hardware_Peripheral entities.\\n\\nRegex - entities with a predefined regex pattern.\\n\\nE.g. - an entity of type regex can have name ‘MobileNumber’ and value \\\\b(?:\\\\d{8}(?:\\\\d{2}(?:\\\\d{2})?)?|\\\\(\\\\+?\\\\d{2,3}\\\\)\\\\s?(?:\\\\d{4}[\\\\s*.-]?\\\\d{4}|\\\\d{3}[\\\\s*.-]?\\\\d{3}|\\\\d{2}([\\\\s*.-]?)\\\\d{2}\\\\1\\\\d{2}(?:\\\\1\\\\d{2})?))\\\\b\\n\\nDuring prediction, if any word in an utterance satisfies this pattern, it will be marked as a MobileNumber entity.\\n\\nContextual - other entities, which are labelled while training and extracted with the appropriate entity extraction algorithm during prediction.\\n\\nWe also have the concept of Entity Synonyms - Suppose the entity with value ‘New York’ is assigned a synonym ‘NY’. In such a case, even if the entity with value ‘NY’ is detected during prediction, the value returned by the entity extractor will be ‘New York’.\\n\\nConfig - This file consists of all the components used for model training, like preprocessors, featurizers, intent classifiers, entity extractors etc. It is necessary for a config to be present for each category, without which model training will not proceed.\\n\\nAdditional components - \\n\\nResponse selector - This is a file consisting of intents and possible bot responses.\\n\\nRegex featurizer - Featurizer based on whether particular regex patterns are present in the utterance. Regex features for entity extraction are currently only supported by the CRFEntityExtractor and the DIETClassifier components!\\n\\nCategory based approach - \\n\\nThe user can define 1-4 categories, each of which contains intents related to that category. For example, a category called ‘Objects and Attributes’ can have intents called ‘Facilities’, ‘DLEmail’ etc. while one called ‘Actions’ has intents ‘Approve’, ‘Apply’, ‘Reinstall’ etc. \\n\\nSay a project has 4 categories, numbered 0-3. This means, users can label utterances with 4 intents - one from each category. For training, 4 individual data files will be created, and one model for each category will be trained from each file. Additionally, one of the files will also have labelled entities as well (category 2 i.e. the third category for 3 or 4 categories; the last category otherwise).\\n\\nAny of the categories can also include regex featurizer or response selector - the config should have the ‘RegexFeaturizer’ or ‘ResponseSelector’ component respectively.\\n\\nGOLD Project - For our GOLD project for the IT use-case, we have four categories\\n\\nQuery Type: Whether the query is an incident, request or enquiry\\n\\nChat Type: Implies request type (provision, permission control etc.) or chat type (small talk, yes/no user responses) \\n\\nObjects and Attributes: To label the kind of entity being talked about in the query (e.g. SoftwareApplication, Facilities etc.)\\n\\nActions: Implies Action (mostly for request, occasionally for incident/enquiry too) (e.g. AddPushAppend, BookBlockReserve) \\n\\nAdditionally, we have entities which are stored in the data for category ‘Objects and Attributes’; regex featurizer patterns for categories 0 and 3; and response selector for chitchat intents in category 1.\\n\\nBackend implementation changes\\n\\nFile                                                                               Rasa 1.10 Format                             Rasa 1.10 implementation                                                                          Rasa 2.0 Format    Rasa 2.0 implementation\\nLabelled utterances                                                                JSON                                         Stored on DB, gets saved to JSON on the fly on triggering a model build                           YAML               Same as Rasa 1.10 but with the new format.\\nEntities                                                                           JSON                                         Stored on category 2 JSON for 3-4 categories;

This feature will be known as Knowledge Management in AELI Studio. This document covers design details about it.\\n\\nDesign Consideration\\n\\nOut of 4 components (AELI Backend, Prediction Engine, AELI UI, NLP Engine) of AELI Studio we will discuss on UI and backend changes required.\\n\\nTo suggest knowledge articles, we have to gather data and train our prediction engine on it. Knowledge article can be in any format - Text, pdf, docx, HTML. So we have to consider input for knowledge articles. \\n\\nNow, considering articles are there and engine is trained on it, we have to provide facility to input user query to be predicted, and show predictions. User can mark any of the prediction output as relevant to given query.\\n\\nBased on discussion above we will design UI with following features.\\n\\nInput for Knowledge Article – file upload (.csv for Question Answer upload, .zip file for document upload)\\n\\nInput for user query.\\n\\nShow prediction output.\\n\\nMark output as Relevant.\\n\\nUsers\\n\\nBased on user role functionality differs. \\n\\nTenant Admin\\n\\nThis user can upload knowledge articles and Question Answers\\n\\nGet prediction for query\\n\\nCustomer or Partner\\n\\nGet prediction for query\\n\\nUI Design\\n\\nKnowledge Search\\n\\nUpload button will be visible to user with role Tenant Admin only\\n\\nPrediction output can be show as below, at most 20 predictions can be shown in pagination or scroll format.\\n\\nEach prediction output will have – 1. Title, 2. relevant text, 3. Link to Document if any, 4. Prediction Confidence, 5. Facility to user mark any prediction as relevant \\n\\nUpload Data Popup\\n\\nUser can upload documents (pdf, docx) in zip file or Question Answers in csv file.\\n\\nUser can add files to existing documents or can overwrite all files.\\n\\nBackend Design\\n\\nAPIs\\n\\nPurpose         Upload documents\\nMethod          POST\\nURL             /project/{id}/km/upload?version={version_number}\\nBody: formdata  {\\n                “file”: file,\\n                replace: boolean\\n                }\\n\\nPurpose    Search Knowledge Article\\nMethod     Post\\nURL        /project/{id}/km/search?version={version_number}\\nBody       {\\n           qeury: string\\n           }\\n\\nPurpose    Mark results relevant to query\\nMethod     Post\\nURL        /project/{id}/km/relevance?version={version_number}\\nBody       {\\n           Id: number,\\n           user_relevance: boolean\\n           }\\n\\nDatabase\\n\\nKM (on worker)\\n\\nTitles (past queries) (has foreign key to answers)\\n\\nAnswers (fields - answer snippet, url, confidence)\\n\\nRelevance (capture every search query and results) (title and answer)\\n\\nIn AELI Studio,\\n\\nKMModelLock\\n\\nId: bigint\\n\\nacquired: boolean', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/KM Integration.docx'}),\n",

What is\\xa0RTGS fund transfer?\\xa0\\nRTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) is the continuous (real-time) settlement of funds transfers individually on an order by order basis. 'Real Time' means the processing of instructions at the time they are received rather than at some later time; 'Gross Settlement' means the settlement of funds transfer instructions occurs individually (on an instruction by instruction basis). Considering that the funds settlement takes place in the books of the Reserve Bank of India, the payments are final and irrevocable.\\n\\n5. When does the beneficiary get the credit for a RTGS Transaction?\\nUnder normal circumstances the beneficiary branches are expected to receive the funds in real time as soon as funds are transferred by the remitting bank. The beneficiary bank has to credit the beneficiary's account within 30 minutes of receiving the funds transfer message.\\n\\n6. If an RTGS transaction is not credited to the beneficiary account, does the remitter get back the money?\\nYes. If the beneficiary's bank is unable to credit the beneficiary's account for any reason, the former will return the money to the remitting bank within 1 hour. Once the amount is received by the remitting bank, it is credited to the remitter's account by the branch concerned.\\n\\n7. Can I schedule an RTGS transaction in advance?\\n\\nYes, RTGS transactions can be rescheduled in advance.\\n\\n8. How would one know the IFSC code of the receiving branch?\\nThe beneficiary customer can obtain the IFSC code from his bank branch. The IFSC code is also available on the cheque leaf.

This way, you are not attempting to capture the highs and lows of the market but rather the cost of your investment is averaged over a period. The essence of SIPs is that when the markets fall, investors automatically acquire more units. Likewise, they acquire lesser units when the market rises. This means that you buy less when the price is high whereas you buy more when the price is low.

The decision should be based on the objective of the program, regional commuting costs and local ordinance requirements. \\n\\nVanpools & Shuttle Bus Provision\\n\\n All ABC Comp Technologies endorsed/sponsored/provided vanpool or shuttle bus vehicles are generally arranged through third-party vendors. Vanpool leasing agreements and shuttle bus services must include insurance liability and follow all current legal requirements for passenger vehicle service. The decision to subsidize vanpools or provide shuttle services is made at the local/regional level based on competitive market conditions and the commute program objectives and requirements. \\n\\nParking Management \\n\\nABC Comp sites may choose to designate parking spaces for employee carpools. Carpool parking spaces should offer a clear advantage over general parking, such as being located close to employee entrances. \\n\\nCarpool parking guidelines regarding eligibility, registration and enforcements should be developed at the local/regional level based on commute program objectives and requirements.\\n\\nElectric Vehicles \\n\\nABC Comp Technologies is willing to consider employees' requests for access to existing electrical outlets and power at no charge and preferential parking for their electrical vehicles. This decision is made at the site level. The employee is responsible for working with the ABC Comp site contact to ensure the availability of suitable power cords and connectors. \\n\\nBicycles\\n\\nABC Comp Technologies may choose to provide secure bicycle parking and shower or locker room access to support bicycle commuting. The decision to provide these amenities is made at the local/regional level based on ability to provide and commute program objectives and requirements. \\n\\nEmergency Rides\\n\\nIn the case of a personal or family illness or other major emergency, some ABC Comp Technologies sites may provide a method of transportation so that the employee who has used a commute alternative can get to the destination to address the emergency. The cost of the transportation method, if any, may be at ABC Comp Technologies' expense.

Messages sent to a list are as secure as any other email. But unlike an email message that you send to an individual, email sent to a list is sent to many different people. You may not know all the people who are subscribed to the list, and if the list is a public or open list, anyone with email access anywhere in the world can subscribe to the list.\\n\\nIt is possible to set up a list that is closed (meaning that the list administrator(s) must approve all subscriptions and/or all postings sent to the list), but that does not prevent a member of the list from forwarding mail that they received from the list to whomever they chose. You might want to consider a list to be much like a bulletin board that everyone can see. Also, if your list is set up to archive mail, future subscribers would be able to read past postings.\\n\\n The point is, it is always wise to consider how what you put in an email message will be perceived by the person reading the message. The lack of body language and voice inflection sometimes makes it possible to interpret an email message in many different ways. This is particularly important in email sent to a list because of the large number of people who may read your message.

You will notice that there are specific URLs for each gateway in the connection drop down list as well but these should not be required unless you experience issues.\\n\\nClick on Connect and you will see the client initiates a connection to the SSL VPN and then states that thePosture Assessment is initiating prior to prompting for a password. Enter your normal Windows password and click OK\\n\\nA pre connection banner prompt is then displayed which you should read and then click Accept to continue. Ifyou click Disconnect your session will terminate. The client then shows that it is establishing the VPN connection.\\n\\nOnce the process has completed a dynamic post connection banner is displayed. This notifies you of the statusof your connection and the message displayed is determined by a number of client security validation checks that take place while the connection is being established with the Cisco VPN gateway.\\n\\nThis is useful as it will provide specific information relative to the level of access attained for that specific VPN session, as well as client security information if a connection is limited or terminated.\\n\\nClient validation checks performed by the VPN gateway on the client include:\\n\\nAntivirus - Application installed, enabled and definition age\\n\\nFirewall -  Application installed & enabled\\n\\nPC – Legitimate ABC Comp PC\\n\\nThe banner message shown below will be displayed when your PC has successfully passed all validation checks and you have been given full employee VPN access to the ABC Comp network.

This certificate is used to validate you as part of the VPN authentication process and will work as expected for the majority of cases. \\n\\nHowever, some of you may have more than 1 personal certificate that you use as part of your job function/role and this may cause problems when attempting to logon to the Cisco VPN.\\n\\nBy default, most users only have 1 certificate and the VPN client is configured to automatically select the certificate when authenticating so there is no user intervention required. However, if your job requires multiple VPN certificates please follow the steps below to configure your VPN client for manual certificate selection.\\n\\nFrom the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client click on the small cog in the bottom left hand corner asshown below.\\n\\nWithin the preferences tab you need to uncheck Enable automatic certificate selection\\n\\n3.The next time that you attempt to logon to the VPN you will be prompted for a certificate to use. Please select the ABC Comp certificate that closest resembles the one shown below, which may be listed as your last name in capital letters.\\n\\n Adding the Cisco VPN Client to Windows Startup\\n\\nYou may want the Cisco VPN client to load at startup with a connection prompt instead of manually having to click on the desktop icon. If this is the case, please follow the steps below to add the icon to startup.\\n\\n 1.

It is basically an easy-to-remember email address that can be used by anyone wishing to send you an email.\\n\\nInternally the messaging systems may route messages to your mailbox using longer email addresses, such as john_jones@exch.ABC Comp.com which are harder to remember, but make messaging more efficient. However, these long addresses are only recognized by the internal messaging systems and cannot be used by users.\\n\\nPeople outside or inside of the ABC Comp Intranet using the long email addresses when sending email to ABC Comp mailboxes may result in mail delivery issues. This is why ABC Comp IT recommends that the 'SEA' be used whenever possible.\\n\\nMore About SEA\\n\\nBy default all employees are assigned an SEA to their mailbox. This usually follows the schema firstname.lastname@ABC Comp.com or firstname_lastname@ABC Comp.com\\n\\nBecause each SEA is unique in the case of a duplicate name there will be differences from the above format. Please do not assume your SEA is always in this format.\\n\\nIn case of an e-mail address conflict, employees who have been with the company longer will have priority in retaining their existing SEA. Newer employees will be required to modify their e-mail addresses to make it unique.\\n\\nContractors and SEA\\n\\nIt is a company policy to distinguish contractors, temporary employees etc. from regular ABC Comp employees.\\n\\nAn SEA for a contractor has the prefix non\\n\\nFor example, mary_smith@non.ABC Comp.com would be a valid SEA for a contractor.\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/25/2020\\n\\nIf a contractor orders a generic mailbox, this too will use the non.ABC Comp.com format.\\n\\nChanging Your SEA\\n\\nIn some cases you may want to change your SEA. For example,\\n\\nYou get married and your surname changes\\n\\nYour name was initially spelt incorrectly\\n\\nYou have a 'common' name and would rather have your SEA use your middle initial or another name as opposed to a number\\n\\nYou are more commonly known by another name, or a less formal name than your SEA is listed as\\n\\nChanges to your SEA can be accomplished via POINTS | Domain & Collaboration Services | ABC Comp Email and PDL tool.\\n\\nGeneric Mailboxes\\n\\nBy default, generic mailboxes are given SEA. This is also to improve communications with external customers.\\n\\nPublic Distribution Lists (PDL)\\n\\nBecause Public Distribution Lists have a similar behavior like other mailboxes - for the same purpose of sending and receiving of messages but to a larger group of recipients listed as members within the PDL, ABC Comp IT cautions users when creating public distribution lists which are meant for internal use only.\\n\\nPDL's simplified e-mail addresses may be compromised and result in:\\n\\nUnsolicited messages or 'spam' being sent over the internet to these public distribution lists\\n\\nHuge amount of data maliciously sent by someone to large PDLs threatening the integrity of our networks Sensitive information potentially or unintentionally sent to the wrong people\\n\\nTo find out more about protecting your public distribution lists, click here\\n\\n2/2\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-135.docx'}),\n",

This only on the express request of the employer. This condition is laid down in the employment contract. The move should take place within a 40 km radius of the office where the employee performs his/her activities. Should the employee be unable to move within the aforementioned period, the period may be extended to one year with approval of Human Resources. However, the employee should be able to prove s/he is actively looking. \\n\\nReimbursements\\n\\nTransport Costs\\n\\nThe evident transport costs (moving van, including any packing of breakables and transport insurance) are reimbursed in full. The employee should submit two quotations of registered moving companies, specifying the number of m3. On the basis of these quotations, the Human Resources Manager will decide which company is to take care of the move. After the Human Resources Manager's approval, the moving bill can be sent to ABC Comp directly. Moving on one's own (provided this is cheaper) is also possible. Either the costs of the use of a private car are reimbursed, based on the mileage for kilometers driven for business purposes, or the rent of a moving van or truck, including fuel costs. \\n\\nRe furnishing Costs\\n\\nAs compensation for re furnishing costs, an allowance of 12% of the gross annual salary is paid, in accordance with the current fiscal norms, with a maximum of EUR 5,445. This is a net payment. \\n\\nTemporary Housing\\n\\nDuring the period up to the actual move (6 months at most), the employee may be eligible for reimbursement of boarding expenses, in combination with a reimbursement of traveling expenses for the weekends. In order to be considered  for  this  reimbursement,  evident boarding  expenses  should  be  made  (at  the  Human  Resources Manager's discretion)\\n\\n1/1\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-388.docx'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"[ATP] Advanced Threat Protection FAQs\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nShirley Sim\\n\\n3/23/17 6:52 PM | Last Updated 3/31/20 10:54 PM\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\nWhat is Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection?\\n\\nOffice 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) helps to secure your mailboxes against advanced threats, providing time-of-click protection against unknown malware and zero-day attacks. ATP delivers several capabilities including Safe attachments, Safe links and rich reporting to help combat sophisticated attacks.\\n\\nWill I see latency now that all email is ATP scanned?\\n\\n Email delivery: Currently, when a Safe attachments policy acts on an email, the message will not be delivered until its attachments can be detonated by the Safe attachments technology. Safe attachments launches a unique hypervisor environment to open and examine the attachment, which typically results in a delivery delay of 2-7 minutes, but could be as long as 30 minutes for some messages.\\n\\n Dynamic Delivery: Dynamic Delivery is a new Office 365 ATP capability that is scheduled to be released later this year. Dynamic Delivery eliminates the latency described above by delivering the body of an email with a placeholder attachment, to be replaced by the actual attachment after it has undergone a Safe Attachments scan. This allows recipients to read and respond to the message immediately, while also notifying them that the original attachment is still being analyzed.\\n\\n Web browsing: If a link points to a website recognized as non-malicious, Safe links adds very little latency to loading the target page. Most people will not notice it at all. If the link points to a website recognized as malicious, the user is routed to a warning page and has to go through it (if click-through is enabled) to continue on to the site.\\n\\nCan ATP identify crypto malware? How does it determine this? What is the false positive rate?\\n\\nBoth Crypto Locker and Locky are detected by ATP. ATP uses an internal sandbox technology which detonates the attachments in VMs and detects any anomalies. It uses several internal tools to detect vulnerabilities triggered by the sample being examined as well as other behavioral analysis to identify malicious activity.\\n\\nSafe Attachments\\n\\nWhat is Safe attachments?\\n\\nSafe attachments helps to protect against zero day exploits in email attachments by blocking messages or attachments that could be malicious. Safe attachments leverages sandboxing technology via a virtual environment to identify suspicious activity. Attachments that don’t have a known malware signature are sandboxed and not released until a behavior analysis is performed and the attachments are determined to be safe. It is designed to detect malicious attachments even before antivirus signatures are available. If an email has multiple attachments, ATP will treat them all as malicious if even one is identified as malicious.\\n\\nWhat is the email delivery latency for attachments that are scanned by Safe attachments?\\n\\nThis can result in a delivery delay of up to 30 minutes for each email evaluated by Safe attachments. The delay time varies depending on the file type with the average time being about four minutes.\\n\\nWhy is there a delay during scanning?\\n\\nTypically, malicious payloads will activate in the sandboxing environment in a few seconds. As attackers become more sophisticated, they have built in delays of several minutes before activation in an effort to trick the sandboxing environment and evade detection. Office 365 ATP helps to safeguard organizations against delayed malware activation by conducting thorough scanning. Given enough time, all malware could be detected and blocked, but that would be very disruptive to mail flow because we would never be able to actually release the messages. Even with ATP protecting your mail flow, it's important to ensure safe message handling practices are being used by your recipients.\\n\\nWhat is Dynamic Delivery?\\n\\nWe recently announced a new capability in Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection called Dynamic Delivery. Dynamic Delivery eliminates latency by delivering the body of the email with a placeholder attachment while the actual attachment undergoes a Safe attachment scan. Recipients can read and respond to the message, which includes notification that the original attachment is being analyzed. If the real attachment is cleared, it is automatically attached to the original message and replaces the placeholder; if not, the message attachment is updated with an attachment which tells the recipient that their original message was identified as malware.\\n\\nCan ATP identify malicious macros being executed? How does it determine this, since macros are commonly used by businesses?\\n\\nYes. A malicious macro would be detected with statistics and heuristics of our ATP detection system. In addition to ATP, a new policy setting in Office 2016 and Office 2013 allows administrators to block macros from untrusted sources.\\n\\nCan Advanced Threat Protection scan archives for malware? If so, what archive formats can it scan?\\n\\nATP can drill into container files (for example, archive, compression, special types) so long as they aren't protected with a password. ATP doesn't scan password-protected archives or encrypted files.\\n\\nHow does Advanced Threat Protection treat multiple versions of the same file? Does ATP scan duplicates?\\n\\nFor example, if 1,000 users received the same file would ATP detonate all 1,000 messages?\\n\\nAfter the first file is scanned, the outcome is applied to other recipients who have received the same file. For example, if File #1 was sent to Employee A and blocked, File #1 will be blocked for all other employees. File # 1 will also be blocked by reputation immediately for all other ATP tenants.\\n\\nWhat file types will Safe attachments detonate?\\n\\nSafe attachments analyzes attachments that are common targets for malicious content, such as Office documents, PDFs, executable file types, and Flash files.\\n\\nSafe Links\\n\\nWhat is Safe links?\\n\\nSafe links provides real-time, time-of-click protection against phishing and malicious web sites by warning users when they click a link in email that has been determined to be unsafe. When a message is processed by\\n\\nExchange Online Protection (EOP), all URLs are scanned and compared with our lists of known bad URLs. ATP Safe links provides an opportunity to re-check the URL reputation lists when the recipient tries to follow the link. Safe links uses URL trace capabilities that allow you to track individual malicious links in messages that have been clicked to support faster remediation.\\n\\nDoes Safe links add any latency to browsing experience?\\n\\nSafe links adds very little latency to loading the target webpage. Most people will not notice it at all. If the link points to a potentially malicious website, then the user is routed to a warning page and may click through (if click through is enabled) to continue on to the site.\\n\\nWhat logic does Safe links use to detect malicious URLs? Does it have a special original malicious URL list or check the website whenever a user clicks the URL?\\n\\nWe keep continuously updated lists of malicious URLs that are updated approximately every 20 minutes.\\n\\nDoes Safe links also decrypt HTTPS and check what’s inside of the Host Header?\\n\\nSafe links doesn't decrypt HTTPS. it checks the destination URL to determine if the page is malicious.\\n\\nHow long is a Safe links rewritten URL valid for? Will it ever expire?\\n\\nThe rewritten URL doesn't expire or time out.\\n\\nHow does Safe links identify a link within an email message?\\n\\nFor messages in HTML, Safe links identifies any link that uses the HREF attribute. For messages in plain text, Safe lLinks uses custom logic to identify any text resembling a URL.\\n\\nReporting and Analysis\\n\\nDoes Advanced Threat Protection perform and capture static analysis, network analysis, and dropped files?\\n\\nThe ATP sandbox solution performs a combination of static and runtime analysis on files and URLs to detect security vulnerabilities. More than simple behavioral monitoring, it also runs tools alongside the app associated with the attachment (for example, Word, Excel). We're building solutions to take advantage of signals across not only cloud services, but also desktop endpoints to detect suspicious behavior across the entire organization.\\n\\nDoes ATP permit syslog export?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nAre files quarantined in EOP or ATP?\\n\\nIn Exchange Online Protection (EOP), spam is quarantined, but malware isn't quarantined. In ATP, a copy of the original message along with any attachments tagged as unknown malware can be forwarded to a specific email address for further investigation, but they aren't quarantined.\\n\\nI’m getting a lot of false positives. How can I report these to Microsoft and get feedback?\\n\\nYou can submit a report via the Malware Protection Center. To view the status of the report, click Track your submission.\\n\\nI have mail that I suspect contains a malicious URL. Can I submit this to Microsoft?\\n\\nYes, you can send email to safelinksfeedback@microsoft.com by using the Subject, “[Potential Malicious URL Submission]”. Please modify the URL so that the link can't be clicked accidentally (that is, change the ‘.’ within the link to ‘_’).\\n\\nSource: Microsoft Technet\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-639.docx'}),\n",

You can also create a restore point yourself whenever you want. \\n\\nStep 1: Hit Start, type “restore” in search and then click “Create a restore point.” On the “System Protection” tab, click the “Create” button.\\n\\nStep 2: Type a description for your restore point that will help you remember why you created it and then click “Create.”\\n\\nIt can take 30 seconds or so to create a restore point, and System Restore will let you know when it’s done. Click “Close.”\\n\\nHow to Restore Your System to an Earlier Restore Point\\n\\nOkay, so you have System Restore enabled, and you’ve been diligent about creating restore points whenever you mess with your system. Then, one fateful day, the inevitable happens–something goes wonky with your system, and you want to restore to an earlier restore point.\\n\\nYou’ll start the restore process from the same “System Protection” tab where you configure System Restore options. \\n\\nStep 1: Hit Start, type “restore,” and then click “Create a restore point.” On the “System Protection” tab, click the “System Restore” button.\\n\\nStep 2: The welcome page of the System Restore wizard just gives you a brief description of the process. Click “Next” to go on.\\n\\nThe next page shows you the available restore points. By default, the only thing showing will probably be the automatic weekly restore point and any manual restore points you’ve created. Select the “Show more restore points” option to see any automatic restore points created before app or driver installations.\\n\\nStep 3: Select the restore point you want–remember, the most recent working restore point is ideal–and then click “Scan for affected programs” to have System Restore detect any programs that will be uninstalled during the process.\\n\\nStep 4: System Restore will present you with two lists. The top list shows you programs and drivers that will be deleted if you restore Windows to the selected restore point. The bottom list shows programs and drivers that might be restored by the process. Again, even programs and drivers that get restored might not function properly until you do a full reinstall.\\n\\nStep 5:  When you’re ready to restore, click the restore point you want to use and then click Next. Note that you can skip the scanning step and just click Next anyway, but it’s always good to see what apps will be affected before you start the process.\\n\\nStep 6: Next, you’re asked to confirm the restoration. Make sure you’ve selected the right restore point and click “Finish.”\\n\\nStep 7: System Restore informs you that once it starts, the restore process cannot be interrupted. Click “Yes” to start.\\n\\nNote: Windows will restart your PC and begin the restore process. It can take a while for System Restore to reinstate all those files– plan for at least 15 minutes, possibly more–but when your PC comes back up, you’ll be running at your selected restore point. It’s now time to test whether it resolved whatever problems you were having. And remember that System Restore creates an additional restore point right before performing the restore process, so you can always undo your actions by performing this same process and selecting that new restore point.', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-937.docx'}),\n",

In this case, the working hours will not exceed 160 hours within any 4 weeks period. \\n\\n3.1.3 Yearly working time model \\n\\nOn very specific cases and justified by strong business requirements, a yearly working model may be used. The working hours will not exceed the statutory maximum for the year as established in the CBA. As of today, this model applies to teams working with summer and winter time schedule. \\n\\n1/1', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-81.docx'}),\n",

What is Bitlocker?\\n\\nBitLocker is Microsoft’s easy-to-use, proprietary encryption program for Windows that can encrypt your entire drive as\\n\\nwell as help protect against unauthorized changes to your system such as firmware-level malware. BitLocker is available to anyone who has a machine running Windows Vista or 7 Ultimate, Windows Vista or 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise, or Windows 10 Pro, however at ABC Comp, BitLocker Encryption will only be used with  Windows 10 Enterprise (only) 1703 and higher. \\n\\nABC Comp uses BitLocker to encrypt Laptop hard drives to ensure the privacy and security of Intellectual Property (IP), Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and company financial data. By utilizing state-of-the-art software- and device-layer encryption to protect the data stored on your drives and monitoring your computer’s startup settings, BitLocker prevents unauthorized personnel from being able to exploit vulnerabilities or access your encrypted information, even if physically moving your hard drive from one computer to another.\\n\\nTechnical Requirements for BitLocker Encryption\\n\\nThe following are requirements for the BitLocker Encryption as implemented at ABC Comp.\\n\\nTPM version must be 2.0 or Later \\n\\nUEFI with Secure Boot should enabled in BIOS. This should be the default settings of computers received new from Dell and HP.\\n\\nClear TPM during re-image process (If the pc is already encrypted with Bitlocker)\\n\\n(Optional) BIOS and Driver update is recommended before Bit locker encryption. \\n\\nSteps to check TPM status and Version on a PC\\n\\na. Check TPM status on a Dell PC\\n\\nPower on the machine and press F12 during the startup to launch Startup options\\n\\nSelect BIOS setup\\n\\nGoto Security -> TPM 2.0 Security\\n\\nSelect TPM 2.0 Security and check if TPM On is checked. \\n\\nc.

Additionally, the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client that is required to initiate a VPN connection will be installed on to each PC that requires remote access capabilities during the PC setup process. Once you have a certificate and the Cisco VPN client all you need to connect is your windows password. \\n\\nIt is the users’ responsibility to organize their own internet connection while traveling and acquire a personal connection via an ISP (Internet Service Provider) and purchasing/installing any necessary hardware (e.g. modems, routers, etc.) if working from home.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY OVERVIEW\\n\\nThe Cisco VPN solution allows all users globally to use one default URL for remote access connections to the ABC Comp network. This solution assesses each connection as it is initiated and sends the connection to the most appropriate VPN gateway based on factors such as latency and speed. This therefore negates the requirement for users having to consider which URL is most appropriate while travelling based on geographic location. \\n\\nThe default connection presented to you when the client application loads should be “Default VPN Connection”. As mentioned under normal circumstances this should never need to be changed and should be used by everyone irrespective of geographical location to connect to the ABC Comp network via remote access. You will notice that there are specific URLs for each gateway in the connection drop down list as well but these should not be required unless you experience issues.\\n\\nThe Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client shown above can be loaded directly from an icon located on the desktop or from the Windows Start Menu and continues to use the current authentication process which only requires you to enter your Windows password.\\n\\nYou will be required to accept the ABC Comp security banner that is displayed and your PC will then be subject to a number of security checks including Firewall, Antivirus and Asset validation.\\n\\nThe outcome of these checks will determine the level of access you receive for that connection attempt. If one or more validation checks fails, then you will not receive full network access and you will be required to remediate your non-compliance issue prior to reconnecting.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nUsage Guideline\\n\\n Information Security Guidelines\\n\\n As Remote Access allows full access to the ABC Comp network, strict security measures must be taken.\\n\\nDo not use the service for inappropriate activities as documented in the Keysight Standards of Business Conduct.\\n\\nEnsure you comply and adhere to all Keysight ISRM IT Security Policies.\\n\\nABC Comp requires that your computer has the standard client firewall and an anti-virus applications installed, running, properly maintained and up to date.\\n\\nDo not write your Windows password on the PC or store it in the device’s memory.\\n\\nSecure hardware and set system passwords as required when not in use. \\n\\nThe user is aware that the equipment is the property of ABC Comp and must be handled accordingly. \\n\\nThe user or his manager will notify the helpdesk immediately of any security breaches or concerns, or employment status changes.\\n\\nUnauthorized client systems not owned by ABC Comp cannot be connected to ABC Comp's network without proper authorization from ISRM. \\n\\nSubscriber Agreement\\n\\n ABC Comp Technologies is granting me remote access to its computer systems through the Remote Access Service. I will use this access in a responsible way only for legitimate company business. I will NOT allow other persons to access ABC Comp Technologies computers through my Remote Access capabilities.\\n\\nOrder/Modify/Cancel Service\\n\\nABC Comp employees using ABC Comp managed PCs for Remote Access are automatically enrolled for this service.\\n\\nRequirement\\n\\nIn order for you to be able to initiate a secure connection with ABC Comp's Cisco VPN remote access solution you will need to have 5 things: \\n\\nA ABC Comp PC with Windows 7, 8.1 or 10 installed. (The Cisco VPN can't be installed and is not supported on Windows XP).\\n\\nA personal certificate on your PC from the ABC Comp certificate server\\n\\nThe Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client installed\\n\\nInternet Connectivity\\n\\nYour Windows password\\n\\nBoth the certificate and Cisco VPN client should be automatically installed onto your PC. However, if you believe one of both of these are missing or not working as expected please contact the IT Help Desk Team via phone email or chat.\\n\\nCost and Billing\\n\\nUsers who subscribe to ABC Comp's Remote Access VPN service do not incur any service activation charges. All costs for service components and usage are centrally billed to ABC Comp.\\n\\nOnly standard costs relating to any Internet connection that may have been provisioned and used to initiate the Remote Access VPN connection will be incurred by users such as any hotel Internet charges.\\n\\nService Level\\n\\nGlobal remote access connectivity is available 24/7.\\n\\nSupport is provided on a 24/7 basis by calling the IT Help Desk Team\\n\\nSupport and Contact\\n\\nTo obtain support for any aspect of ABC Comp's Cisco Remote Access VPN solution please contact the  IT Help Desk Team via phone email or chat.\\n\\nNote: Please find attached the Remote Access Overview document with the index details.

Not all resources require VPN access, and as ABC Comp transitions to a Hybrid-Cloud environment, it may be hard to determine when a remote access solution is needed. The general rule is: Collaboration & Communication apps are usually available without VPN; apps that fall outside of this category, will usually require VPN access to communicate with. an incomplete short list is below, to help you identify the difference.\\n\\nSites Reachable Without the VPN:\\n\\n\\tEmail (Outlook Client & Outlook Web)\\thttps://outlook.office365.com\\n\\n\\tOffice 365 work streams e.g. SharePoint\\thttps://portal.office.com \\n\\nOnline and OneDrive links, Microsoft Teams\\n\\nCisco Jabber Instant Messenger, Jabber Phone\\n\\nServices for Employees *\\n\\n\\tCisco Webex\\thttps://keysight.webex.com \\n\\n\\tSlack\\thttps://keysight.slack.com/\\n\\n\\tIT Service Portal\\thttps://itsupport.keysight.com\\n\\n\\tMicrosoft MyApps Portal **\\thttps://myapps.microsoft.com **\\n\\nSites that require a VPN connection:\\n\\n\\tInside ABC Comp intranet\\thttp://inside.keysight.com\\n\\nPOINTS ordering system\\thttp://apps.is.keysight.com/points People Finder\\thttps://people.is.keysight.com/\\n\\n\\tiProcurement\\thttps://oprdk.is.keysight.com/OA_HTML/AppsLogin \\n\\n\\tActive Roles\\thttps://activeroles.it.is.keysight.com/ \\n\\nNKWs approved for Jabber\\n\\nSoftphone\\n\\n- Jabber Phone Services for NKWs will require a VPN connection to work, however, employees can also use Jabber Soft phone while off-VPN and working at home to access to all phone services via Jabber.\\n\\n* - Some sub-sections or contained apps will require VPN for full functionality.\\n\\nHow do I Connect the VPN?\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/26/2020\\n\\nThis will depend on your relationship with ABC Comp - Employees and Contractors use different VPN solutions due to the layers of security we have implemented.\\n\\nIf you are a ABC Comp Employee (@ABC Comp.com email address) you will log in with the Cisco AnyConnect VPN. This should come pre-installed on your ABC Comp device, and should only require your current ABC Comp password in order to connect. We recommend using the Default Connection option, as this should connect you to the fastest server available at the time.\\n\\nIf you are Keysight Contractor (@non.keysight.com email address) you will log in with the Palo Alto Networks VPN (PAN). There will be a short setup required in order to log in, as this is not pre-loaded on Keysight devices.

Errors will most often be encountered while using a web browser (Chrome and Internet Explorer are the ABC Comp IT supported browsers at this time) and attempting to access a website external to ABC Comp. Some examples are provided below.\\n\\nIssues can also be experienced when connected to ABC Comp via Employee VPN, or coming from an authorized Contract Manufacturing location which uses ABC Comp for Internet access.Issues might also be encountered when using certain secured applications which are accessing external resources. \\n\\nErrors for these applications can vary widely, but will almost always point to an untrusted certificate or certificate error.If you have not received an error similar to those described above, or shown in the examples below, indicating a security certificate issue, then disregard this document and contact ABC Comp Support.\\n\\nWhy am I seeing these errors?\\n\\nIn order to provide a secure work environment for its employees, protect company intellectual property and protect against fraudulent use of the corporate network, ABC Comp IS inspects all traffic leaving ABC Comp. This inspection requires that some connections, which are encrypted, be decrypted so that the content can be checked. \\n\\nThis decryption process requires the use of ABC Comp ‘certificates’ and those systems and/or applications which are not utilizing the authorized certificates will cause the inspection to break, and the traffic will be blocked.The documentation in this guide and in the referenced self-help procedures will assist most users in properly addressing any missing certificates, as appropriate.\\n\\nIssues not covered by this guide\\n\\nSome errors with certificates can be encountered which are not caused by the decryption process and are therefore not covered by this documentation. Examples of errors which are not covered here include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n\\n\\tErrors seen on the ‘BYOD’ (mobile wireless ‘bring your own device’ network, used by employees on nonABC Comp managed devices without authenticating to Wave) as Internet access from this network is not being inspected by this process\\n\\nErrors seen on the ‘GUEST’ wireless network (used by non-employees who do not have ABC Comp NT accounts) as Internet access from this network is not being inspected by this process\\n\\nErrors seen accessing resources within ABC Comp (Peoplefinder, Arinso, My ABC Comp, etc.) as internal traffic is not being inspected by this process\\n\\nErrors seen on servers in any of the following networks accessing the Internet, as traffic these network is not being inspected by this process\\n\\nData Center servers/devices\\n\\nExtranet servers/devices (Kcom, O365, DNS, etc)\\n\\nR&D servers/devices\\n\\nInstruments subnets\\n\\nIS system subnets\\n\\nSite Services (fire systems, security cameras, etc)\\n\\n     Error Examples (Internet Browsers)\\n\\nThe screenshots below represent the most common errors seen when encountering an issue with certificates and the decryption process. These examples are from browsers on Windows devices but similar messages will be seen on browsers which run on other operating systems (Mac OS, Linux, etc).\\n\\nThe below is an example of a certificate error encountered when using Internet Explorer.\\n\\nFigure 1-1.   Security Certificate Error (Internet Explorer)\\n\\nError Examples \\n\\nThe below is an example of a certificate error encountered when using Internet Explorer.\\n\\nchrome 3/25/2014 , 3:47:12 PM SSL Error - Google Chrome\\n\\nFigure 1-2.   Security Certificate Error (Chrome)\\n\\nThere are two ways for you to resolve this issue with the browser on your device:\\n\\nAccept the temporary certificate and continue to the website Install the ABC Comp Root certificate on your device.\\n\\nTo accept the temporary certificate, follow the procedure found in the next section, ‘Accepting the Security Certificate’. Note that this will provide access to the website in most cases, but will only last until you disconnect from the site, restart your device, or clear your browser cache.\\n\\nTo permanently install the ABC Comp Root certificate on your device (recommended), please see the document ‘Certificate Installation on Windows OS’ for Windows browsers, or ‘Certificate Installation on Mac OS’ for Mac OS browsers.\\n\\nFor non-browser issues with certificates, please see the section at the end of this document, ‘Resolving Certificate Issues (non-browser related)’.\\n\\nAccepting the Security Certificate\\n\\nFigure 1-3.   Accept Temporary Certificate (Internet Explorer)\\n\\nTo accept the certificate, which is coming from the ABC Comp edge firewall at your location or VPN, click the red shield ‘Continue to this website (not recommended)’. \\n\\nThis is not normally recommended for web access outside of ABC Comp network, but in this case the edge firewall is providing your device a temporary certificate, in place of the Trust Chain which is missing, and will then allow you to continue to the secure site.\\n\\nWARNING: The option will not work on Firefox browser. Also, there are some applications (such as Webex) which will not function correctly if the first option is taken even on a device where it would normally work. The best option is to install the ABC Comp certificate Trust Chain by the process below.\\n\\nResolving Certificate Issues (non-browser related)\\n\\nIn some cases, issues resulting from the decryption process will be encountered on non-Windows or Mac OS platforms, or with applications unrelated to the use of a browser or web client. Please see if one of the following subsections describes your issue, and see the recommended course of action for that issue.\\n\\nIf you do not find anything in this document which appears to pertain to your particular issue, please contact ABC Comp Support via an Click here ticket for assistance.\\n\\nLinux (Ubuntu, Debian)– To resolve issues related to browsers or applications running on a Debian or ubuntu linux platform, please refer to the appropriate section of document ‘Certificate Installation – Linux Systems’\\n\\nLinux (CentOS 5)– To resolve issues related to browsers or applications running on a CentOS 5 linux platform, please refer to the appropriate section of document ‘Certificate Installation – Linux Systems’ Linux (CentOS 6)– To resolve issues related to browsers or applications running on a CentOS 6 linux platform, please refer to the appropriate section of document ‘Certificate Installation – Linux Systems’ AWS CLI and Python (Mac OS system) – To resolve issues related to Python scripts or applications, or inside the AWS cli running on a Mac OS system, please refer to the appropriate section of document ‘Certificate Installation on Mac OS’\\n\\nNPM Package Manager (JavaScript Node.js) – To resolve issues related to NPM,  please refer to the appropriate section of document ‘Certificate Installation – Applications’\\n\\nChrome Browser (non-Windows or Mac OS platform) – To resolve issues related to the use of Chrome browser on a non-Windows or non-Mac OS platform,  please refer to the appropriate section of document ‘Certificate Installation – Applications’\\n\\n Java Client (on Windows) – To resolve issues related to the Java Client on a Windows platform,  please refer to the appropriate section of document ‘Certificate Installation – Applications’\\n\\n Helm Package Manager (Helm Charts, Kuberbetes Helm, Kubernetes package manager) – To resolve issues related to the Helm package manager,  please refer to the appropriate section of document ‘Certificate Installation – Applications’\\n\\nPIP Package Manager (Pip, Pip3, Python package manager) – To resolve issues related to the Pip  package manager,  please refer to the appropriate section of document ‘Certificate Installation – Applications’ Git version control manager (GitHub, git-scm.com) – To resolve issues related to Git,  please refer to the appropriate section of document ‘Certificate Installation – Applications’\\n\\nSoftware Development server(s) – Any software development servers should ideally reside in one of the designated ISG Lab, Test/Dev or R&D networks which are designed for these types of systems.

       " Document(page_content='6/26/2020\\n\\nWindows 10 and admin privileges: Exception process\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nPat Devine\\n\\n1/31/17 1:53 PM | Last Updated 3/31/20 5:46 PM\\n\\nWhy are we doing this…\\n\\nAs we are making the switch to Windows 10 we are also making big changes to the way we manage the features within it. Of course, one of the biggest concerns is security. In the past we have observed issues with viruses being able to make their way onto machines and possibly compromising very sensitive company data.\\n\\nOne of the biggest measures we can take in eliminating these security threats is to remove a virus’ ability to operate on a PC. In doing so we have to remove the administrative privileges that are inherently given to the account. The unfortunate downside to this is also removing the administrative privileges from the user. If we limit the amount of time a machine has access to run with elevated privileges, we can also reduce the possibility and in most cases stop a virus’ ability to install or run on a machine.\\n\\nWhat we have as an alternative…\\n\\nWe know that it is crucial that you have flexibility and the tools in order to be productive and successful. To address that, standard users will have the ability to install a script from SCCM that will give you a 4-hour time window in which you can run or install programs that need admin level privileges.\\n\\nIf you are a developer…\\n\\nFor some users the need for admin level privileges is constant and crucial. For those groups of users who work in development and related lines of work you either should be or will be part of an exception group in which admin level privileges will be available to you.\\n\\nIf you feel that you require admin level privileges…\\n\\nWhile we are restricting admin privileges for most of the users within ABC Comp, the ability to have it is possible under certain conditions:\\n\\n Provide a solid justification for the need to have permanent admin access. A good example of this would be software that needs to have admin privileges in order for it to run or perform certain functions.

If Outlook is not running, a client-side rule cannot be processed. Client rules also will not run unless the same user who created the rule logs into Outlook.\\n\\nCreating rules in Outlook is simple. \\n\\nIn Outlook, click the File tab and then click the Manage Rules and Alerts button. By default, the Email Rules tab is selected. To create the rule, click New Rule. This will launch the Rules Wizard.\\n\\nIn the Rules Wizard you can select from a set of pre-designed templates or use a blank rule to handle messages the way you want them handled.\\n\\nTip\\n\\nWhen you create a rule you are given the option to run the rules for all emails in your inbox. If you missed this checkbox, you can always go back and run the rules anytime. Go to the Manage Rules and Alerts dialog and select Run Rules Now.\\n\\nServer Rules\\n\\nServer rules are handled entirely by the Exchange Server and are applied to messages that arrive in your inbox even when Outlook isn’t running. Server rules handle rule operations that don’t require the Outlook client. Server rules are created two ways – by using Outlook Web Access (OWA) or by using Outlook. Rules created in OWA are always saved as server-side rules.\\n\\nSome examples of a server rule include:\\n\\nChanging the importance of a message\\n\\nMoving the incoming message to a specific folder on the user’s mailbox Deleting a message\\n\\nTo create a rule using OWA, go to the navigation pane and click Rules and in the Rules area toolbar, click New. This will open the Edit Rule dialog box. You can also right click any email message in OWA and left click Create Rule.\\n\\nTo create a server rule in Outlook, select an email you have already received. Click the Home tab in the ribbon if it is not already selected. In the Move group select Rules then Create Rule.\\n\\nNote:\\nPlease verify whether it is a client rule or server rule.\\n1. If client rule does not work as expected then make sure that there are no recent changes happened in Outlook Client Example: Outlook reinstallation was not performed, user has not changed the computer, etc. On this scenario the user need to recreate the rules if those are missing in Outlook 2. Make sure that the conditions are all valid on the affected rule.\\nExample: Sender/Recipient email address is correct, selected folder name is correct and it still exist in Outlook, etc. Delete and recreate the correct rule accordingly and then check the status.', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-469.docx'}),\n",

It noted that in recent weeks, there has been registration of domain names containing the phrase “coronavirus”, with a combination of the words such as “help,” “relief,” “victims,” and “recover”. It said that malicious actors are likely to post links to fake charities and fraudulent websites that solicit donations for relief efforts or deliver malware.\\n\\nHere are 3 tips to protect yourself from COVID-19 Cyber attacks\\n\\nImpersonation Scams\\n\\nScammers may impersonate as government officials to request for your personal and/or financial information, on the pretext of contact tracing or data verification. If you receive such emails or calls, always verify the authenticity of the person, by visiting the official website or contacting the government agency hotline number.\\n\\nEcommerce Scams\\n\\nScammers may cash in on the surge in demand for certain medical products (e.g. surgical masks, hand sanitizers) by promising delivery of the items. In some cases, the scammers may demand for further payment of custom duties or delivery charges after the first payment is made. Where possible, always purchase from known or trusted sources/vendors, and look out for independent reviews regarding the vendors.\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/26/2020\\n\\nPhishing Emails or SMSs\\n\\nCybercriminals may send phishing emails or SMSs to trick individuals into opening malicious attachments or clicking on suspicious links on the pretext of reading important information regarding the COVID-19 situation. Always refer to official government agency websites for the latest information on the situation.\\n\\nIf you received a suspected phishing email, use the Phish Alarm <Report Phish> button to submit the email to the Cybersecurity team. If you are not able to locate the button, create a new message, attach the suspected phishing email to the message and send it Cybersecurity@ABC Comp.com\\n\\nLet us all do our part to stay safe and secure, both physically and digitally. Please let me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nBest Regards, Scott Sources: \\n\\nCISA: https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/03/06/defending-against-covid-19-cyber-scams \\n\\nICC: https://www.icc-ccs.org/index.php/1288-coronavirus-investment-fraud-and-cyber-scam-warnings WHO: https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/02/1058381\\n\\n2/2', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-920.docx'}),\n",

With Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, you can protect your mailboxes against new, sophisticated attacks in real time. By protecting against unsafe attachments and expanding protection against malicious links, it complements the security features of Exchange Online Protection to provide better zero-day protection.\\n\\nProtect against unsafe attachments\\n\\nWith Safe Attachments, you can prevent malicious attachments from impacting your messaging environment, even if their signatures are not known. All suspicious content goes through a real-time behavioral malware analysis that uses machine learning techniques to evaluate the content for suspicious activity. Unsafe attachments are sandboxed in a detonation chamber before being sent to recipients. The advantage is a malware free and cleaner inbox with better zero-day attack protection.\\n\\nProtect your environment when users click malicious links\\n\\nExchange Online Protection provides protection against malicious links by scanning content. Safe Links expands on this by protecting your environment when users click a link. While the content is being scanned, the URLs are rewritten to go through Office 365. The URLs are examined in real time, at the time a user clicks them. If a link is unsafe, the user is warned not to visit the site or informed that the site has been blocked. Reporting is available, so administrators can track which users clicked a link and when they clicked it.\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/26/2020\\n\\nSafe Links Enablement and URL rewriting\\n\\nWhen Safe Links feature is enabled, URLs which ATP thinks or suspects to be unsafe will be rewritten with https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/ converting the URL into a long encrypted and embedded string of alphanumeric characters which you hover your mouse over the URL link e.g: Original URL: https://ABC Comp.webex.com/start/audrius.puikysABC Comp.com\\n\\nSafe Link URL: https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/? url=https%3A%2F%2FABC Comp.webex.com%2Fstart%2Faudrius.puikysABC Comp.com&data=01%7C01%7Caudrius.puikys%40ABC Comp.com%7Cf1cf1653235d4e4285d408 However, when you click on this URL which is examined by Office 365 and determined to be safe, you will simply be redirected to its original URL. \\n\\nSource: Microsoft Technet\\n\\n2/2', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-999.docx'}),\n",

Instead the employee may receive the lease amount that is valid for his/her level as a monthly cash amount. Any part of this amount that can be paid out net as a commuting allowance will be paid net. The remainder is subject to taxation; the applicable taxation and social premiums will be withheld every month. \\n\\nParticipation in this scheme is only allowed for employees who have no lease car: All running contracts need to be terminated by the employees before participating in this Plan. Alternatively, employees could apply for the plan max. 6 months before contract end date. \\n\\nPlease note that this Cash alternative is only applicable at the end of a current lease agreement or when starting a new company car contract.  \\n\\nEligibility\\n\\nThis cash alternative is only applicable for employees that participate in the car scheme as a benefit. In any case where the lease car is considered (partly) as a tool by ABC Comp (necessary for the job, as decided by the manager and the Country Manager Human Resources), this alternative scheme does not apply. Also in the case where the status of the employee changes from benefit to tool driver, \\n\\nOther reasons to stop participation\\n\\nIf for any other reason the company car entitlement (temporarily) ceases to exist, also the cash alternative ceases to exist and will be (temporarily) stopped. An example of a situation where this could occur is be long term unpaid leave.\\n\\nValidity of this scheme\\n\\nThis cash alternative plan is fully dependent on the Company Car scheme. If the car scheme changes, this is automatically incorporated into this plan. If there is any conflict between the Car Scheme and this alternative cash plan, the car scheme’s terms and conditions prevail emphatically at all times.\\n\\n1/1', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-50.docx'}),\n",

This is expected, because the passwords for your user account and login keychain no longer match. \\n\\nIf you didn't see an alert about your login keychain, or you see other messages asking for your old password, reset your keychain manually:\\n\\nOpen Keychain Access, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder. \\n\\nChoose Preferences from the Keychain Access menu, then click the Reset My Default Keychain button in the preferences window. After you enter your new password, Keychain Access creates an empty login keychain with no password.

Deployment of BeyondTrust PowerBroker for Windows Locations Affected:        All regions Date of Change:              May 16th    \\n\\nWHAT IS HAPPENING?\\n\\nOver the next 6 months ABC Comp will be rolling out an additional security application to all Windows PCs. This application, BeyondTrust PowerBroker, will help protect ABC Comp computers from unknown malware that may get past our existing anti-malware defense i.e. Symantec Endpoint Protection.   \\n\\nCurrently, over 50% of PCs within ABC Comp have full admin rights. Exploiting admin rights on PCs is one of the most common methods malware uses to compromise PCs.  By taking over control of admin rights on a PC, PowerBroker can provide specific applications the rights they need to run while blocking malware from running and reducing the likelihood of malware infections. PowerBroker will eventually replace the temporary and permanent admin rights program in use today.\\n\\nHow are you impacted\\n\\nThe deployment of this tool will be in several phases. The first phase, starting this week (and running for most of Q3), will deploy\\n\\nPowerBroker, via SCCM, in monitor only mode.  Monitor only mode should be transparent and have no impact on the operation of your PC.  The next phase starting in Q4, PowerBroker will switch from monitor only to actively taking control of how applications obtain admin rights.   \\n\\nDuring Q3 and Q4 the project team will be working with business contacts across ABC Comp to understand their needs for admin rights and build rules within PowerBroker to ensure a seamless transition from monitoring to controlling admin rights.  \\n\\nACTION REQUIRED\\n\\nStarting this week and running through Q3, PowerBroker will be deployed via SCCM. No reboot of your PC will be required after PowerBroker has been installed.  \\n\\nIf you have any problems after the update, please contact the IT Helpdesk. \\n\\nQuestions\\n\\nIf you have questions about this change, or want to find out more, please send an email to the project mailbox adminrights.project@ABC Comp.com\\n\\n1/1', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-751.docx'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Mailbox Terminations Guidelines / Email Business Continuity Process\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nShirley Sim\\n\\n2/6/17 3:43 PM | Last Updated 3/31/20 9:29 PM\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhen an employee leaves the company, the employee’s associated Windows Active Directory Account and Email Exchange mailbox will be disabled and scheduled for termination as part of ABC Comp’s Termination Policy.\\n\\nWhat does \\'Disabled State\\' mean?\\n\\nBy ABC Comp\\'s definition, an account in a disabled state refers to the account or mailbox in a state awaiting final deletion from the IT environment.\\n\\nFor a Windows Active Directory Account, it is disabled for 60 days before the account is permanently purged from the IT environment by our automated Terminations process.\\n\\n For an Exchange mailbox, it is disabled for 30 days before the account is permanently purged from the Exchange server by our automated Terminations process. The Exchange mailbox for the employee or NKW can only continue to exist as long as his or her Windows Active Directory Account still exists.\\n\\nDuring this period, nobody has access to the mailbox and the Email Address is hidden from view in the Outlook Address Book although new incoming messages may still be delivered to the mailbox. In addition, you may notice that the mailbox name still shows up under the manager\\'s Organization reports tab in the Outlook Address Book.\\n\\nWhile in this state, the mailbox could be reinstated as long as the employee-ID or NKW ID is reactivated back to\\n\\nActive status by the manager. If a manager has reactivated or extended the expiration of an NKW in\\n\\nSuccessFactors, the mailbox will be automatically reactivated once the employment status is flagged to ‘Active’ again.\\n\\nHowever, no re-activation of the mailbox is possible if the Employee ID or NAW ID remains in \\'Terminated status\\' and/or not found in PeopleFinder. The mailbox will remain in a disabled state for 30 days from the employment end date of the employee and eventually purged from the mail server. At that point, no reactivation of mailbox or access to the data in the mailbox is possible. All associations to existing PDL memberships as well as manager reporting line will cease and the mailbox will be automatically dropped. There is no necessity or action required to have the associations manually removed while in a \"disabled state\" as they will be automatically handled by background terminations and cleanup processes.\\n\\nOptions to Minimize Business Impact to ABC Comp for Customer-Facing Employees who have exited the company\\n\\nIn view of business continuity needs of some organizations, ABC Comp IT provides a workaround to minimize the impact of leaving employees who may continue to receive email after their exit from the company. A combination of the following options can be requested by contacting the IT Help Desk and submitting a request to be routed to the Messaging Support Team.\\n\\n\\tOption 1\\tOption 2\\n\\nSetting up an Out of Office AutoReply on the user\\'s mailbox notifying senders of change for up to 30 days\\n\\nNote. The standard duration is for 30 days and the maximum duration is for 60 days. ABC Comp IT is unable to support requests greater than 60 days.\\n\\nHowever, if the employee is in a customer-facing role where there is a need to keep his or her e-mail address beyond 60 days, you have the option of requesting ABC Comp IT to deregister the e-mail address from the terminated employee’s mailbox and move it to an active mailbox e.g. Generic mailbox as Setting up an Auto-Forwarding so that all new email sent to user will be redirected to the manager or a delegate the manager approves of (please note that only 1 address is allowed and configurable). Setting up autoforwarding to external email addresses is not possible or allowed.\\n\\nNote. The standard duration is for 30 days and the maximum duration is for 60 days. ABC Comp IT is unable to support requests greater than 60 days.\\n\\nHowever, if the employee is in a customer-facing role where there is a need to keep his or her e-mail address beyond 60 days, you have the option of requesting ABC Comp IT to deregister the e-mail address from the terminated employee’s mailbox and move it to an active mailbox e.g. Generic mailbox as Option 3\\n\\nExtracting of existing mail data\\n\\nthat resides in the employee\\'s Exchange mailbox into a Personal Folder (PST) file and transfer to the manager or delegate by the support team\\n\\nNote. There is strictly no access into the employee\\'s mailbox. This process does not cover any mail data which has been archived or stored locally into PST files on the employee\\'s PC.\\n\\na secondary SMTP address for receiving a secondary SMTP address for receiving capability.\\tcapability.\\n\\nAn email approval from the manager of the exiting employee as well as local HR is required so as to ensure that the request adheres to any local country or legal guidelines concerning data privacy (if any). To speed up the process for your request, please have the email approval ready. Your request will then be channeled to the ABC Comp Email Service Manager for final approval.\\n\\nIn the event where your request is not approved or more information is required, you will be contacted by the ABC Comp Email Service Manager.\\n\\nIf  you have any questions or need clarifications about this process, please contact the ABC Comp Email Service\\n\\nManagement PDL', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-619.docx'}),\n",

Below are excerpts from\\n\\nApple's guide, for full detailed guide please refer to this KB from Apple\\n\\nHow to reset the SMC on Mac notebooks\\n\\nFirst, determine whether the battery is removable. Most older Mac notebooks have removable batteries. Mac notebooks that have nonremovable batteries include MacBook Pro (Early 2009 and later), all models of MacBook Air, MacBook (Late 2009), and MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015 and later). Learn more about Mac notebook batteries.\\n\\nIf the battery is nonremovable:\\n\\nChoose Apple menu > Shut Down.\\n\\nAfter your Mac shuts down, press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the built-in keyboard, then press the power button at the same time. Hold these keys and the power button for 10 seconds.\\n\\nIf you have a MacBook Pro with Touch ID, the Touch ID button is also the power button.\\n\\nRelease all keys.\\n\\nPress the power button again to turn on your Mac.\\n\\nIf the battery is removable:\\n\\nShut down your Mac.\\n\\nRemove the battery. If you need help removing the battery, contact an Apple Authorized Service Provider or Apple Retail Store.\\n\\nPress and hold the power button for 5 seconds.\\n\\nReinstall the battery.\\n\\nPress the power button again to turn on your Mac.\\n\\n2/2\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-983.docx'}),\n",

The attacks were likely introduced via an email attachment and quickly spread across vulnerable systems seriously impacted operations at several UK hospitals and other businesses and may have infected more than 2000,000 computers globally.1\\n\\nAdditional Information\\n\\nWannaCry has two components, a worm and a ransomware package. The worm spreads using the leaked NSA exploit ETERNAMBLUE and DOUBLEPULSAR which exploits a Server Messaging Block (SMB) vulnerability that was patched with Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010 in March 2017 for supported versions, and on 13 May 2017 for legacy operating systems. \\n\\nThe ransomware package also installs TOR which it uses for C2 communications. The initial version had a DNS based kill switch that was implemented stopping the worm. However, the subsequent variant does not have a kill switch.\\n\\nWhat is the Potential Impact?\\n\\nAlthough there are no indications that ABC Comp has been impacted yet, if the ransomware is introduced into the ABC Comp network, the attacks could quickly spread across vulnerable unpatched and legacy operating systems throughout ABC Comp’s enterprise, encrypting files and rendering the systems unusable.\\n\\nWhat You Can Do To Help\\n\\nBecome knowledgeable about the attack and its indications\\n\\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack)\\n\\nImmediately remove a compromised system from the network by removing the network connection or unplugging it from the electrical outlet.\\n\\nContact ABC Comp IT Help Desk to report the incident immediately. An critical support ticket will be created and assigned to the ABC Comp IT ISC Incident Response Team for detail investigation.

There are more dynamic video algorithms with this version, allowing you to resize your video to get 380p, 720p, or 1080p video quality.  In addition, your video quality will depend on what location you are joining a Webex from.  If you are in a large ABC Comp location, there is generally more bandwidth available to you to participate in a Webex meeting.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you on a home network and are connected via VPN, you video quality could be affected.  We recommend that if you are on your home network and need to connect to a Webex meeting, you disconnect from  your VPN and connect to the Webex over the internet.\\n\\nQ3. Will 33.6 support 720p video resolution?\\n\\nA3. Yes, Webex meetings can support up to 1080p video quality if you connection can support it.\\n\\nQ4.

Will PTools (or Webex Productivity Tools) be available in Software center after the upgrade?\\n\\nA8.No, the outlook plugin will no longer be available in Software Center, instead, users will download the Webex Desktop App directly from the ABC Comp.webex.com share which includes the Outlook Add-in which gets added back into your Outlook application.\\n\\nQ9. Can you stream a live video file during a Webex Meeting?\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/26/2020\\n\\nA9. No, that feature is not available with this version of Webex, however, it will be coming in a future upgrade.\\n\\nQ10. After the upgrade, will we need to do anything to be able to schedule a Webex meeting through Outlook?\\n\\nA10. Yes, starting on 20 May, users will need to download the Webex Desktop App either when they are prompted, or directly from ABC Comp.webex.com.  Ensure that Outlook is closed and install the application.  Once installed, users can open Outlook and continue to schedule Webex meetings as before.\\n\\nQ11. Do you need to download and install the Desktop App every time you join a meeting?\\n\\nA11. No, once you install the application, you will not need to download it again until you are prompted for  the next latest version to install.\\n\\nQ12. Does the “taking notes” feature during a Webex appear only on your screen, or is it viewable to all Webex participants?\\n\\nA12. . The notes you take during the Webex meeting are only viewable to the user that is taking them, at the end of the meeting, it is saved as a .TXT file to the “My Documents” folder of the user.\\n\\nQ13.

Yes, they are available on our Service Portfolio page for Conferencing Services.\\n\\nQ14: Will Executive Administrators still be able to schedule on behalf of their Managers?\\n\\nA14: Yes, these settings will not change, but you can verify by having the manager login to their Webex profile, navigate to \"Preferences -> Scheduling\".  Ensure that the needed Executive Administrator\\'s e-mail address is listed in the \"Scheduling Permissions\" field.\\n\\nQ15. Will users be able to find old recordings on the ABC Comp.webex.com webpage?\\n\\nA15. Yes, you will be able to view your old recordings in the ABC Comp.webex.com portal in the recordings page.\\n\\nQ16. Are we required to select at least 2 TelePresence rooms to schedule a TelePresence meeting with Webex?\\n\\nA16.

If you have just added your Windows Account as a member into the Mail-enabled Global Group associated with the Shared (Generic) mailbox, it may take up to 30 mins to 2 hours for the permissions to be replicated into O365 Cloud to take effect.\\n\\nThere are 2 methods for viewing Shared (Generic) mailboxes in Outlook that ABC Comp users are most familiar with. ABC Comp IT will provide instructions for these 2 methods that users may opt to use based on their preferences.\\n\\nMethod 1 - Add Account\\n\\nABC Comp IT highly recommends this method due to the ability to select the amount of data that you can cache to your local PC to help optimize PC performance and Outlook latency issues with accessing email in a Microsoft cloud-hosted environment. 1. In Outlook, go to File | Info | Add Account\\n\\nYou will be prompted to provide details about the Shared (Generic) mailbox. Follow the instructions in red shown in the screen capture and click Next.\\n\\nOutlook will take several minutes to complete the set up. \\n\\nWhen you are prompted that the email account has been successfully configured, select Change Account Settings and click Next.\\n\\nYou will be prompted the name of the Shared (Generic) mailbox and the amount of data to keep offline in a Cached mode. By default, this is configured for 12 months.ABC Comp IT recommends you to keep this default settings. \\n\\nHowever, you may use the slider to move left and right to define your own preference. The longer duration you choose to keep offline, more hard disk space is needed on your PC to store the cached OST file as it equates to the size of the Shared (Generic) mailbox. Do note that O365 Shared (Generic) mailboxes each have a maximum 50 GB size limit.\\n\\nClick Finish to complete the set-up.\\n\\nYou will be prompted to restart Outlook. Click OK, then manually exit Outlook.\\n\\nRe-launch Outlook. You will see a splash screen indicating it is preparing Outlook for first use ... This is normal as your Shared (Generic) mailbox will be accessedwith cached Exchange mode enabled to store 12 months of email offline (by default). Outlook is preparing a new cached OST file on your PC in the background which will synchronize email from the Shared (Generic) mailbox.\\n\\nOnce you get into Outlook, you will find the additional Shared (Generic) mail added as a secondary mailbox in your profile. \\n\\nMethod 2 - Open Additional Mailboxes\\n\\nIn Outlook, go to File | Info | Account Settings\\n\\nUnder Email tab, select your email address and click Change\\n\\nClick More Settings\\n\\nNavigate to the Advanced tab and click Add to open additional shared (generic) mailboxes.\\n\\nYou will be prompted for the Shared (Generic) mailbox name. Use part of or the complete email address of the Shared (Generic) mailbox. Click OK.\\n\\nWhen returned to the previous screen, you will see that the Shared (Generic) mailbox is configured to be open as additional mailbox. \\n\\nImportant - By default, the Download Shared Folders option is not enabled. This means that the additional mailboxes will be access in an Online mode directly with the Microsoft-hosted O365 cloud environment. Some users may find accessing in this method may result in undesirable PC performance and Outlook latency issues.\\n\\nYou may enable the Download Shared Folders option so that the data for your shared mailbox will be cached locally. However, this method may not allow you to choose partial amount of data to be cached. All mail data in the Shared (Generic) mailbox will be cached and the size of the cached OST file on your PC will be similar to the size of the Shared (Generic) mailbox. There is a maximum 50 GB size limit.\\n\\nClick OK to complete the set-up.\\n\\nClick Next\\n\\n8.Click Finish.\\n\\nClick Close to exit Account Settings wizard completely.\\n\\nYou may be prompted to exit and restart Outlook for changes to take effect. Otherwise, you will see your additional Shared (Generic) mailbox added to your Outlookprofile immediately.', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-672.docx'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"[EXO] Blocked attachments in Outlook\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nShirley Sim\\n\\n3/23/17 5:21 PM | Last Updated 3/31/20 10:48 PM\\n\\nTo help protect your computer, Outlook doesn’t allow you to receive files of certain types (such as .exe files) as attachments, because of their potential for introducing a virus into your computer.\\n\\nBy default, Outlook will block these file types.\\n\\nShare your files safely\\n\\nIf you want to receive a file of a type that is blocked by Outlook, you can ask the sender to either make the file available without using Outlook, save the file to the cloud, or make it less likely to be blocked by Outlook. The following are some safe ways to share files with people that you trust.\\n\\n Use a shared server or the cloud   \\n\\nYou might want to ask the sender to save the attachment to the cloud, a server, or an FTP site that you can access. This can include OneDrive or a secure network share server such as SharePoint. The sender can send you a link to the attachment on the server or FTP site. You can click the link to access the file and save it to your computer.\\n\\nNote: For OneDrive and OneDrive for Business, you'll need to ask the sender to only send you a link to the file rather than attach the file to the email using OneDrive. To obtain a sharing link in OneDrive, highlight the file and choose Get Link in the menu bar.\\n\\n Use a file compression utility   \\n\\nUsing a compression utility, such as WinZip, creates a compressed archive file that has a different file name extension. Outlook doesn’t recognize these file name extensions as potential threats. Therefore, it doesn’t block the new attachment. Many third-party compression utilities are available.\\n\\nNote. If you are expecting to receive an executable file such as .exe or .msi file, simply compressing the file may still result in file attachments being blocked. Consider adding encryption to the zip file with password protection in Winzip so that you will know it is safe to receive the file from your sender. This has been tested by ABC Comp IT to ensure this method of delivery of attachments will work.\\n\\n Rename the file   \\n\\nYou can request that the sender rename the attachment to use a file name extension that Outlook doesn’t recognize as a threat. For example, an executable file that has the file name extension .exe could be renamed as a Word file that has a .docx file name extension.\\n\\nNote. In some cases, renaming of executable files such as .exe and .msi files would not completely solve the issue and may still result in file attachments being blocked. ABC Comp IT would recommend to use a file compression utility with password-protect encryption enabled in order for file attachments to be received in ABC Comp. \\n\\nAsk the sender to resend the renamed attachment to you. To save the attachment and rename it to use the original file name extension, do the following:\\n\\nLocate the attachment in the email message.\\n\\nRight-click the attachment, and then click Copy.\\n\\nRight-click the desktop, and then click Paste.\\n\\nRight-click the pasted file, and then click Rename.\\n\\nRename the file to use the original file name extension, such as .exe.\\n\\nAttachment file types blocked in Outlook\\n\\nFile name extension File type\\n\\n.ade     Access Project Extension (Microsoft)\\n.adp     Access Project (Microsoft)\\n.app     Executable Application\\n.asp     Active Server Page\\n.bas     BASIC Source Code\\n.bat     Batch Processing\\n.cer     Internet Security Certificate File\\n.chm     Compiled HTML Help\\n.cmd     DOS CP/M Command File, Command File for Windows NT\\n.cnt     Microsoft Help Workshop Application\\n.com     Command\\n.cpl     Windows Control Panel Extension (Microsoft)\\n.crt     Certificate File\\n.csh     csh Script\\n.der     DER Encoded X509 Certificate File\\n.exe     Executable File\\n.fxp     FoxPro Compiled Source (Microsoft)\\n.gadget  Windows Vista gadget\\n.grp     Microsoft program group\\n.hlp     Windows Help File\\n.hpj     AppWizard Help project\\n.hta     Hypertext Application\\n.inf     Information or Setup File\\n.ins     IIS Internet Communications Settings (Microsoft)\\n.isp     IIS Internet Service Provider Settings (Microsoft)\\n.its     Internet Document Set, Internet Translation\\n.jar     Java Archive\\n.jnlp    Java Network Launch Protocol\\n.js      JavaScript Source Code\\n.jse     JScript Encoded Script File\\n\\nFile name extension File type\\n\\n.ksh      UNIX Shell Script\\n.lnk      Windows Shortcut File\\n.mad      Access Module Shortcut (Microsoft)\\n.maf      Access (Microsoft)\\n.mag      Access Diagram Shortcut (Microsoft)\\n.mam      Access Macro Shortcut (Microsoft)\\n.maq      Access Query Shortcut (Microsoft)\\n.mar      Access Report Shortcut (Microsoft)\\n.mas      Access Stored Procedures (Microsoft)\\n.mat      Access Table Shortcut (Microsoft)\\n.mau      Media Attachment Unit\\n.mav      Access View Shortcut (Microsoft)\\n.maw      Access Data Access Page (Microsoft)\\n.mcf      Media Container Format\\n.mda      Access Add-in (Microsoft), MDA Access 2 Workgroup (Microsoft)\\n.mdb      Access Application (Microsoft), MDB Access Database (Microsoft)\\n.mde      Access MDE Database File (Microsoft)\\n.mdt      Access Add-in Data (Microsoft)\\n.mdw      Access Workgroup Information (Microsoft)\\n.mdz      Access Wizard Template (Microsoft)\\n.msc      Microsoft Management Console Snap-in Control File (Microsoft)\\n.msh      Microsoft Shell\\n.msh1     Microsoft Shell\\n.msh2     Microsoft Shell\\n.mshxml   Microsoft Shell\\n.msh1xml  Microsoft Shell\\n.msh2xml  Microsoft Shell\\n.msi      Windows Installer File (Microsoft)\\n.msp      Windows Installer Update\\n.mst      Windows SDK Setup Transform Script\\n.ops      Office Profile Settings File\\n.osd      Open Software Description\\n.pcd      Visual Test (Microsoft)\\n.pif      Windows Program Information File (Microsoft)\\n.pl       Perl script\\n.plg      Developer Studio Build Log\\n.prf      Windows System File\\n.prg      Program File\\n.ps1      Windows PowerShell\\n.ps1xml   Windows PowerShell\\n.ps2      Windows PowerShell\\n.ps2xml   Windows PowerShell\\n.psc1     Windows PowerShell\\n\\nFile name extension File type\\n\\n.psc2      Windows PowerShell\\n.pst       MS Exchange Address Book File, Outlook Personal Folder File (Microsoft)\\n.reg       Registration Information/Key for W95/98, Registry Data File\\n.scf       Windows Explorer Command\\n.scr       Windows Screen Saver\\n.sct       Windows Script Component, Foxpro Screen (Microsoft)\\n.shb       Windows Shortcut into a Document\\n.shs       Shell Scrap Object File\\n.tmp       Temporary File/Folder\\n.url       Internet Location\\n.vb        VBScript File or Any Visual Basic Source\\n.vbe       VBScript Encoded Script File\\n.vbp       Visual Basic project file\\n.vbs       VBScript Script File, Visual Basic for Applications Script\\n.vsmacros  Visual Studio .NET Binary-based Macro Project (Microsoft)\\n.vsw       Visio Workspace File (Microsoft)\\n.ws        Windows Script File\\n.wsc       Windows Script Component\\n.wsf       Windows Script File\\n.wsh       Windows Script Host Settings File\\n.xbap      Browser applications\\n.xll       Excel add-in\\n.xnk       Exchange Public Folder Shortcut\\n\\nApplies To: Outlook 2016Outlook 2013\\n\\n Source: Microsoft Technet\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-638.docx'}),\n",

This process applies only when a ABC Comp Worker has an active NID or has recently terminated his NID status and is being converted to be a ABC Comp employee.\\n\\nWhen an NKW is being converted to a regular ABC Comp employee, s/he will be assigned an Employee ID (EID) along with a new Windows Domain Account. All IT services associated with his NID will be terminated alongside his NKW assignment end date.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this results in somewhat a loss of user productivity as the NKW may not necessarily change his job scope, but merely an employment status, with access to IT services being disrupted. To help to mitigate and minimize job disruption, this NKW conversion process is introduced to prepare user for the change in his/her employment status and for the new IT services to be set up in anticipation of the actions needed to be performed by the employee.\\n\\nEmail Conversion Process\\n\\nThere are 2 parts to the E-mail Conversion Process:\\n\\n\\t\\tPart I.

To get Admin Privileges on Windows PCs  \\n\\nIt is recognized that the availability of admin access on Windows PC's is one of the main vectors for malware and virus infections.  \\n\\nSeveral external assessments of ABC Comp’s IT environment, including one that was done with Verizon and one that was done DELL after a security breach event that took place just prior to the separation from of Agilent, highlighted that the removal of admin rights as one of the top actions to be taken to reduce the likelihood of a successful security breach.  \\n\\nA recent report from one of the security vendors noted that for windows and windows products:\\n\\nOf the 251 vulnerabilities in 2015 with a Critical rating, 85% were concluded to be mitigated by removing administrator rights\\n\\nThere has been a 52% year by year rise in the volume of vulnerabilities since 2014\\n\\n86% of Critical vulnerabilities affecting Windows could be mitigated by removing admin rights\\n\\n99.5% of all vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer could be mitigated by removing admin rights\\n\\n82% of vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Office could be mitigated by removing admin rights\\n\\n85% of Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities could be mitigated by removing admin rights 82% Critical vulnerabilities affecting Windows 10 could be mitigated by removing admin rights\\n\\n63% of all Microsoft vulnerabilities reported in 2015 could be mitigated by removing admin rights.\\n\\nIn addition, ABC Comp’s engagement with A/D businesses and government mandates is leading to more scrutiny in this area.   ABC Comp has DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement) requirements that is focused on Unclassified Controlled Technical Information (UCTI) data for a small number of ABC Comp clients.  ABC Comp also faces requirements of ISO 171, which deals with a much broader set of unclassified data that ABC Comp must be compliant with by end of 2017. \\n\\nOn the product side, we are seeing trends in regards to software development practices.  For example, vetting each line of code that goes into products we sell to the government not be that far off.  This will result in an increased focus on the client environment that is used to create the code.  \\n\\nThe industry direction is to provide admin access to applications and not to users. We do not have this capability today but it is on ABC Comp’s roadmap.\\n\\nWhile admin access is not the default, all employees can temporarily request admin access.\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/26/2020\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe reference document that is driving the removal of admin rights at ABC Comp is NIST Special Publication 800-171. It is attached here. The switch from Admin mode to User mode is derived from controls 3.1.5, 3.1.6 and 3.1.7 found on page 19.

       " Document(page_content='6/25/2020\\n\\nInformation on Exchange Public Distribution List (PDL)\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nTCS Office 365 Team\\n\\n2/6/17 3:59 PM | Last Updated 4/28/20 3:04 PM\\n\\nWhat is a Public Distribution List?\\n\\nA public distribution list, most commonly referred to as a PDL is basically just a list of mailboxes as its members. They are used as an easy way to send messages to a larger set of mailboxes without having to type in each individual address into the TO: field.\\n\\nIn ABC Comp, the PDL must contain either ABC Comp Exchange mailboxes, contact addresses and/or other public distribution lists that are visible in the Outlook Global Address List. External email addresses are not allowed to be added to Exchange PDLs.\\n\\nWho Is Allowed To Own a PDL?\\n\\nAnyone with a valid ABC Comp Employee ID or a Non-ABC Comp Worker (NKW) NID is allowed to own a PDL. PDLs should be set up for cases where more than one person needs to have access to the list. In situations where only the owner is going to be using the list, it would be easier and highly recommended to set up a personal distribution list in your own Outlook Contacts.\\n\\nThe SMTP Address of the PDL - whether an @ABC Comp.com or @non.ABC Comp.com address is assigned to the PDL is determined by the Employee ID or NID that the PDL is registered to.\\n\\nYou can order a PDL through POINTS under Domain & Collaboration Service | ABC Comp Email and PDL section. From within POINTS you can also rename the PDL, change the owner of the PDL and delete the PDL.\\n\\nNote. When an employee leaves the company, all PDLs, Generic mailboxes, Generic Contacts owned by this employee will be auto-assigned to his or her manager.\\n\\nWhat Can or Can\\'t I Alter On My PDL?\\n\\nYou can modify the members of the PDL yourself within your Outlook Global Address Book. Members can include other ABC Comp mailboxes including generic mailboxes as well as other ABC Comp PDL\\'s.\\n\\nIt is not possible to add external mailboxes, such as those you might have in your personal address book or contacts list to a PDL. Not only is this a technical limitation as Exchange PDL can only contain addresses that can be found within the Outlook Global Address List, this would also add a security risk, because it would allow auto-forwarding of email to external recipients.\\n\\nAs the owner of a PDL you cannot grant additional people administrator or editor roles to help manage your PDL on your own. Currently there is no automated process for users to request for additional editors to be added so you have to request this manually if you have a need to delegate the responsibility to manage your PDLs. Submit a request via the IT Help Desk.\\n\\nHow Can I Control Who Can Send To A PDL?\\n\\nBy default, anyone can send to newly created PDLs. Owners of existing PDLs can use an access control list (Authorization PDL) to control who can send their PDL.\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/25/2020\\n\\nUsing an Authorization PDL:\\n\\nPrevents \\'Reply-To-All\\' to your messages\\n\\nPrevents unauthorized mailing to members of your PDL\\n\\nPrevents mail from outside of ABC Comp from reaching your PDL\\n\\nTo find out more about using Authorization PDL, click here.\\n\\nNaming Conventions and Other Naming Information\\n\\nIt is standard for the last name to start with \\'PDL\\'. This can then be followed by your organization name. You should use another key word such as a geography or project name for the first name. Note that there is a limit of 40 characters maximum for the length of the PDL name.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nPDL-IT, MESSAGING-PM helps us to recognize this as an \\'IT\\' PDL which relates to messaging.\\n\\nOther Important Information\\n\\nIT will conduct periodic audit on empty PDLs where no members have been added to a newly created PDL in the first 30 days of creation. These empty PDLs will be assumed inactive and deleted without warning. It is the employee’s responsibility to ensure that PDLs that are in use need to contain at least 1 member.\\n\\nYou can find out which PDL\\'s you belong to by selecting your mailbox from the Global Address Book within Outlook, and selecting the \"Member Of\" tab.\\n\\n2/2', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-136.docx'}),\n",

Do I need to migrate to/enroll for new certificates?\\n\\nA. If you don’t use ABC Comp VPN or Wi-Fi services there is no need to enroll for new certificates.  If you are connecting to the ABC Comp network via VPN and/or Wi-Fi, you need to enroll for the new certificates. Those will accept only the new certificates after Dec 31st.\\u2009 Please check the communications sent for the rollout schedule to find the exact date for each VPN gateway or Wi-fi change.  \\n\\nHowever, if you use a ABC Comp provided/managed device and work from a ABC Comp physical office then our user and device management solutions (Active Directory) already performed the certificate enrollment for you. \\n\\nIf want to verify that you have the new certificate installed and ready to-go, please visit the question entitled: How do I check my certificates.  \\n\\nQ. How do I check my certificates?\\n\\nA. The easiest way to verify if you have the new certificate installed is to run ABC Comp Certificate Installer tool. Running the tool will not attempt to enroll for a new certificate if one is already found on your PC. \\n\\nDownload (http://pki1.keysight.com/KTCertificateInstaller.exe) and run the tool. Then look for the message: “Valid MS certificate found… “\\n\\n(Please use a different browser than Internet Explorer to download the tool, because it will be blocked by its SmartScreen filter).  \\n\\nAnother way to verify, is to manually run certificate manager windows management console and check your user certificates.   \\n\\nStart - Run – certmgr.msc \\n\\nOr search for certmgr.msc under your start menu\\n\\nLook under Certificates / Personal  \\n\\nHere you see a list of your user certificates. Check the Issued By column. \\n\\nSymantec certificates are issued by: “ABC Comp Technologies Inc. CA” PKI \\n\\nMicrosoft certificates are issued by: “ABC Comp Technologies Inc. CA1 G3”  \\n\\nThe below screenshot shows a user enrolled with both Symantec and Microsoft certificates. \\n\\nQ. How do I install the new certificate? – I have a ABC Comp managed PC\\n\\nA.  1. If you have a ABC Comp managed device and work from a ABC Comp physical office, then under normal circumstances the certificate should be already installed.  If you verified and is not installed (see the How do I check my certificates section) then you can force the auto-enrollment process by opening a command prompt window with administrative privileges:     Start – Run – Cmd.exe    Then run this command:  \\n\\n   C:\\\\> certutil -pulse   \\n\\nIf this does not give any results please review the ComAround article entitled \"Business Partner Process to Enroll for a Microsoft VPN/Wi-Fi Certificate on a ABC Comp Managed Device\"\\n\\n.  \\n\\n    2. If you have a ABC Comp managed device and don’t work from a ABC Comp physical office, then most probably your device is not actively managed, so you need to install the certificate like you would have an un-managed device. Please review the \"How do I install the new certificate? - I don\\'t have a ABC Comp PC\" section for more information.\\n\\nQ. How do I install the new certificate? - I don\\'t have a ABC Comp PC\\n\\nA. If you have an un-managed ABC Comp device or a device provided by your own company then please follow the instructions below to install your new certificate: \\n\\nShort version here, to install the new certificate you can: \\n\\nrun ABC Comp Certificate Installer tool  or perform manual enrollment \\n\\nor contact Helpdesk if the other methods did not work \\n\\nUsing ABC Comp Certificate Installer tool \\n\\n\\t\\tDownload (http://pki1.keysight.com/KTCertificateInstaller.exe) and run the tool.  \\n\\nI can’t download the ABC Comp Certificate Installer tool \\n\\nPlease use a different browser than Internet Explorer to download the tool. This browser blocks unknown files even if it is code signed.   ABC Comp Certificate Installer tool shows some errors in the background \\n\\nIt is preferred to run the tool with administrative privilege (right click the file and select Run-As Administrator). \\n\\n ABC Comp Certificate Installer has no connectivity to PKI server \\n\\nThe tool will initially check if it has network connectivity to the ABC Comp PKI servers. If it does not succeed it will exit with the following error:  \\n\\nPlease make sure you connect first to ABC Comp network : remotely via VPN, or in physical office by Wi-Fi or wired ethernet.  \\n\\nABC Comp Certificate Installer tool fails to run on Windows 7 \\n\\nIf your pc runs Windows 7 you do need to run the tool with admin privileges, otherwise it will fail. If you can’t get admin privileges then you need to perform manual enrollment using manual enrollment process.  \\n\\nAlso, on Windows 7 if the system does not have all the updates and patches installed, the tool will also fail with an error like below: \\n\\nDepending on various checks about your pc operating system and version the tool might ask you to authenticate multiple times and open a certificate enrollment wizard. Please use your ABC Comp NT Account and password to authenticate and just click through the wizards. \\n\\nAt the end the tool should show you a message if the new certificate was installed or not.  \\n\\n Performing manual steps to enroll for a certificate   \\n\\nIf the tool was unable to install the certificate it will indicate an error has occurred and will point you to the IT Self Help article with the manual enrollment steps. \\n\\nCall IT Service Desk for assistance  \\n\\nIf none of the provided enrollment methods work, then please call ABC Comp IT for further assistance.  http://it.keysight.com/helpdesk/support/phone.htm \\n\\nQ. I am a new Business Partner.  How do I enroll for a certificate?\\n\\nA. If you have a ABC Comp managed pc and work from a ABC Comp office, then you will be auto-enrolled with a certificate. Please see the \"How do I check my certificates?\" section.   \\n\\nFor all other scenarios:  \\n\\nReceive a temporary 7-day certificate from ABC Comp IT Helpdesk via email. \\n\\nConnect to ABC Comp VPN using the temporary certificate.  \\n\\nEnroll for a permanent certificate by one of the methods in the \"How do I install the new certificate? – I don’t have a ABC Comp PC\" section\\n\\nQ. Certificate enrollment fails with \"The EMail name is unavailable and cannot be added...\" error\\n\\nA.  You need to run a different installer that works for ABC Comp business partners who have not been issued a ABC Comp email address.  Please visit the \"no ABC Comp email\" article for access to the installer and instructions to complete the process. \\n\\nQ.  Certificate enrollment fails with error \"The certificate authority is invalid or incorrect...\"\\n\\nA.  Download this Entrust root certificate and install it in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities folder of you PC security store.   Double click on the downloaded certificate and follow the wizard to complete the installation.  When prompted, please select the Trusted Root Certification Authorities folder location to install the Entrust root certificate.\\n\\nQ.  Certificate enrollment fails with \"The URI entered above has ID:.....This ID conflicts with an existing ID\"\\n\\nA.  You are attempting to manually enroll for your certificate from a ABC Comp managed device.  Please submit an IT Help Desk ticket so             the Active Directory issues on your PC can be resolved.  Once your PC is re-joined to the ABC Comp domain, the auto-enrollment                  process should automatically deliver the certificate to your PC.', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-899.docx'}),\n",

Also make sure you know the password for the secondary account, this will be needed later\\n\\nThere must be at least 1 accounts enabled for FileVault.

       " Document(page_content='6/25/2020\\n\\nHow do I Post a Message to the List?\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nTCS Office 365 Team\\n\\n2/8/17 2:05 PM | Last Updated 4/28/20 4:47 PM\\n\\nTo send or post a message to the list, send an email message to the address listname@general.lists.ABC Comp.com. Enter the subject and content information as you normally would.\\n\\nReplying to a Posted Message\\n\\nIf you would like to reply to a message that someone else has sent, simply choose Reply as you would for any other message. Depending on how the list is set up, you may be asked if you want to reply to just the original sender or to the whole list. Before you reply to the whole list, consider carefully whether your response is of interest to everyone or just the original poster.\\n\\nGeneral Posting Netiquette\\n\\nWhen posting to a list, be aware that some people get hundreds of email messages a day. These people do not want to receive unnecessary messages and they may get rather testy if they do. So be sure that any messages you post to a list are interesting and useful to those who read the list (messages like \"Great!\", for example, are rather useless) and especially that the message is relevant to the list. If people start \"email arguments\" do not participate. These are considered a misuse of ABC Comp resources and therefore violates the Standards of Business Conduct.\\n\\nA Word on Privacy\\n\\nEmail sent to a list is as secure as any other email. But unlike an email message that you send to an individual, email sent to a list is sent to many different people. You may not know all the people who are subscribed to the list and if the list is a public list, anyone with email access anywhere in the world can subscribe to the list.\\n\\nIt is possible to set up a list that is closed (meaning that the manager(s) of the list must approve all subscribers) and private (meaning that only subscribers to the list may send to the list), but that does not prevent a member of the list from forwarding mail that they received from the list to whomever they chose. You might want to consider a list to be much like a bulletin board. It may be like the board that is in the back hallway of your office suite or it may be a kiosk. In either case many people will be reading the messages that you send and the more people who read a message, the less the message is private.\\n\\nThe point is, it is always wise to consider how what you put in an email message will be perceived by the person reading the message. The lack of body language and voice inflection sometimes makes it possible to interpret an email message in many different ways. This is particularly important in email sent to a list because of the large number of people who may read your message.\\n\\n1/1', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-149.docx'}),\n",

In addition to your approval, additional mitigating controls will be put in place to manage any risk associated with having Windows 7 PCs on the ABC Comp network. It is also worth noting that ABC Comp IT is no longer offering Windows 7 compatible hardware as PC hardware vendors such as Dell and HP are already shipping new PCs with new processors which are only compatible with Windows 10 I have outline below the reasons for my request for a Windows 7 exception. \\n\\n1.

Executable files or .exe files are allowed. \\n\\n Files with a *.tmp or *.ds store extension are not supported. User may not upload desktop.ini, thumbs.db, or ehthumbs.db.\\n\\n Invalid file or folder name characters in OneDrive are:  # (number sign), % (percent), < (less than), > (greater than), : (colon), \" (double quote), | (pipe), ? (question mark), * (asterisk), / (slash), and \\\\ (backslash).\\n\\n File name paths can generally have up 400 characters; however, in some scenarios the limit may be less than that, especially if there is a very long URL path for the affected library. If you think this may pertain to you, check folder properties before and after migration to ensure that the numbers for size, number of folders, and number of files match.\\n\\n OneNote files can be in OneDrive, but you can\\'t use standard windows features to move or copy them there.  The only way to move a OneNote notebook from a PC to OneDrive is to open it inside of OneNote, right click on the name, select properties, then select \"move\".  Using any other method to move OneNote files will cause synchronization issues.   \\n\\nUsing OneDrive sync client (e.g., sync files from cloud storage to client PCs):\\n\\nAll points above also apply to the sync feature. \\n\\nAlthough SharePoint Online can store 30 million documents per library, the sync performance of OneDrive may decline when you store more than 100,000 files in a single OneDrive site or team site library. To avoid this limitation, ensure that files are stored in multiple folders and libraries. You can sync files up to 15GB.\\n\\n Syncing ‘My Documents’ files is not recommended; instead, move files to a new folder before syncing. \\n\\nFor more information, see Restrictions and Limitations when you sync OneDrive for Business\\n\\nData and Files:  Do’s \\n\\nABC Comp Confidential data and ABC Comp Private data may be uploaded and stored in OneDrive. \\n\\nUsage of OneDrive will refer to ABC Comp IT Information Security Policies that apply.\\n\\n (http://one.it.keysight.com/security/policies/policies.asp). You can refer to section “3.0 Data Identification and Handling v1.0”.\\n\\n User can use OneDrive sync client to backup files from PC or Mac to the OneDrive cloud storage. During the setup of OneDrive sync client, the OneDrive folder called ‘OneDrive – ABC Comp Technologies’ will be created. Files and folders in the ‘OneDrive – ABC Comp Technologies’ folder will be sync to OneDrive cloud storage. User can place files and folders for backup in this folder. For PC, user has to selectively identify files and folders to sync for backup and not sync system files like C:\\\\Windows*. For more information on how to setup OneDrive sync client, read article Setup OneDrive Sync Client.\\n\\nData and Files: Don\\'ts\\n\\n OneDrive’s sharing capabilities should never be used to share any confidential data with the public, or anyone who does not need access.\\n\\n OneDrive is not designed to store or sync software programs, source codes and database files to cloud. OneDrive may not be used in place of standard source control software. Recommended alternatives include Bitbucket and Team Foundation Server. IT does not support issues with software programs, source codes and database files stored in OneDrive.\\n\\n Users can only sync offline or archived Outlook PST files like in a zipped format to OneDrive. Microsoft does not support syncing active Outlook PST files. The PST files cannot be in open state at any time when the file is in OneDrive folder. A PST file that is connected to Outlook will be updated regularly and therefore if synchronized, can result in too much network traffic and growth of the Office File Cache on the local drive resulting in performance issue. \\n\\nData Privacy Statement\\n\\nThe following personal attributes are synced from ABC Comp AD to Microsoft O365/OneDrive in the cloud:\\n\\nFirst Name\\n\\nLast Name\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nABC Comp E-mail Address (Display Name)\\n\\nSign-In Name (ABC Comp e-mail address)\\n\\nUser Principal Name (ABC Comp e-mail address)\\n\\nCity\\n\\nPostal Code\\n\\nCountry\\n\\nState\\n\\nOffice Street Address\\n\\nDepartment\\n\\nOffice Location\\n\\nOffice Fax #\\n\\nOffice Phone #\\n\\nMobile Phone #\\n\\nUsage Location (e.g. US)', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-333.docx'}),\n",

You cannot make someone stop sending you email or prevent them from disclosing it to others. A very effective way to protect your Primary Address and reduce the risk of receiving spam is to create and use a temporary DEA.\\n\\nHow Does DEA work?\\n\\nWithout compromising your Primary Address, you can create and maintain up to 20 custom Disposable Email Addresses for various purposes, such as:\\n\\nWeb Site registrations\\n\\nE-commerce transactions\\n\\nNewsgroup postings / Public Forums\\n\\nChat sessions\\n\\nMailing List subscriptions\\n\\nPosting address on the Web in a \\'mailto\\' link\\n\\nWhen mail is sent to a Disposable Email Address, it is automatically forwarded to your existing Primary Email Address as a privacy protection / anti-spam tactic. By giving out a different DEA every time you are asked for one, you can easily identify and block sources of spam without affecting the rest of your Email. Any DEA guilty of delivering unsolicited Email can simply be deleted. This provides a proactive measure against receiving any further spam from that source. If any future Email sent to the deleted DEA, it will bounce back to the sender while not affecting your \\'hidden\\' Primary Address.\\n\\nDisposable Email Addresses are designed primarily to receive Email from sources to which you don\\'t want to give your Primary Address. Safely provide a DEA to anyone and not have to worry about whether they will send you unwanted Email or sell your Email address to others. You can use each DEA once and if you receive spam via the DEA, you will know exactly who spammed you or leaked the address to spammers.\\n\\nImportant to Note\\n\\nTo avoid being a victim of Email address harvesters, use a Disposable Email Addresses for public consumption.\\n\\nDo not use DEAs for ABC Comp business purposes because it would prohibit replies from potential business partners unless they were to respond quickly and turning off a disposable address.\\n\\nA DEA is *not* traceable to either you or your Primary Address.\\n\\nOnly ABC Comp domains can be used for creating DEAs.\\n\\nYour old DEAs cannot be reused by anyone other than yourself.\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/25/2020\\n\\nIf your Primary Email Address is already getting Spam, you may need to change that address and then use DEAs to control spam to your mailbox.\\n\\nOnly the account owner can add, delete, or modify their own DEAs.\\n\\nCreate DEA\\n\\nDEA can be created in POINTS under the Domain & Collaboration Service | ABC Comp Email and PDL section. A maximum of 20 DEAs can be maintained for each account you own.\\n\\nName the custom Email Address\\n\\nThe DEA should be named to help associate its usage. Addresses can use only letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), periods (\".\"), and underscores (\"_\") and, like all Email addresses, they are not case-sensitive. Do not use short Email addresses because they can be easy to guess but limit the total length to a maximum of 40 characters.\\n\\nHere are some suggested Email address formats:\\n\\nsmith-yahoo-reg@ABC Comp.com jones-ebooks@ABC Comp.com allen-news-msword@ABC Comp.com amy-chat3@ABC Comp.com rogers-list-newsweek@ABC Comp.com untrusted.2004.01.23@ABC Comp.com\\n\\nAdd a Usage Note\\n\\nTo additionally identify the usage of the DEA, a Usage Note, of up to 40 characters long, can be created to help associate its usage. By tracking which DEA was used for a particular purpose, you can determine which ones should be disposed of (e.g. Receiving spam).\\n\\nSet an Auto-Expiration Date\\n\\nSet an Auto-Expiration date on which the DEA can be configured to expire (be deleted) automatically after a pre-specified time frame. Any mail sent to the DEA after the expiry date will bounce back to the sender. To prevent an auto-expiration of the DEA, set this value to Never. By setting this date to Never, the DEA may route undesirable Email to your Primary Email Address (SEA) until the DEA is manually removed.\\n\\nModify DEA\\n\\nThe address, usage note and expiration date can be modified for any pre-existing Disposable Email Address.\\n\\nDispose DEA\\n\\nIf you start getting spam via a particular DEA, you know which recipient to blame, and you can terminate that DEA. Your DEA can be deleted manually at any time or it may have been configured when created to selfdestruct on a pre-specified expiration date. Setting the expiration to \\'Never\\' will allow you provide the DEA for legitimate purposes until you receive spam, at which point you can manually delete it.\\n\\n2/2', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-138.docx'}),\n",

It works by requiring any two or more of the following verification methods:\\n\\nAzure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Microsoft's two-step verification solution. Azure MFA helps safeguard access to data and applications while meeting user demand for a simple sign-in process. It delivers strong authentication via a range of verification methods, including phone call, text message, or mobile app verification.\\n\\nHow Azure Multi-Factor Authentication works?\\n\\nThe security of multi-factor authentication lies in its layered approach. Compromising multiple authentication factors presents a significant challenge for attackers. Even if an attacker manages to learn the user's password, it is useless without also having possession of the trusted device. Should the user lose the device, the person who finds it won't be able to use it unless he or she also knows the user's password.\\n\\nAzure Multi-Factor Authentication helps safeguard access to data and applications while meeting user demand for a simple sign-in process. It provides additional security by requiring a second form of authentication and delivers strong authentication via a range of easy verification options.\\n\\nMethods available for two-step verification\\n\\nPhone Call: A call is placed to a user’s registered phone asking them to verify that they are signing in by pressing the # sign or entering a PIN.\\n\\nText Message: A text message will be sent to a user’s mobile phone with a six-digit code. Enter this code in to complete the verification process.\\n\\nMobile App Notification: A verification request is sent to a user’s smart phone asking them complete the verification by selecting Verify from the mobile app. This will occur if you selected app notification as your primary verification method. If they receive this when they are not signing in, they can choose to report it as fraud.\\n\\nMobile app verification code: The mobile app, which is running on a user’s smart phone, displays a 6-digit verification code that changes every 30 seconds. The user finds the most recent code and enters it on the sign-in page to complete the verification process. This will occur if you selected a verification code as your primary verification method.\\n\\n2/2\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-262.docx'}),\n",

It noted that in recent weeks, there has been registration of domain names containing the phrase “coronavirus”, with a combination of the words such as “help,” “relief,” “victims,” and “recover”. It said that malicious actors are likely to post links to fake charities and fraudulent websites that solicit donations for relief efforts or deliver malware.\\n\\nHere are 3 tips to protect yourself from COVID-19 Cyber attacks\\n\\nImpersonation Scams\\n\\nScammers may impersonate as government officials to request for your personal and/or financial information, on the pretext of contact tracing or data verification. If you receive such emails or calls, always verify the authenticity of the person, by visiting the official website or contacting the government agency hotline number.\\n\\nEcommerce Scams\\n\\nScammers may cash in on the surge in demand for certain medical products (e.g. surgical masks, hand sanitizers) by promising delivery of the items. In some cases, the scammers may demand for further payment of custom duties or delivery charges after the first payment is made. Where possible, always purchase from known or trusted sources/vendors, and look out for independent reviews regarding the vendors.\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/26/2020\\n\\nPhishing Emails or SMSs\\n\\nCybercriminals may send phishing emails or SMSs to trick individuals into opening malicious attachments or clicking on suspicious links on the pretext of reading important information regarding the COVID-19 situation. Always refer to official government agency websites for the latest information on the situation.\\n\\nIf you received a suspected phishing email, use the Phish Alarm <Report Phish> button to submit the email to the Cybersecurity team. If you are not able to locate the button, create a new message, attach the suspected phishing email to the message and send it Cybersecurity@ABC Comp.com\\n\\nLet us all do our part to stay safe and secure, both physically and digitally. Please let me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nBest Regards, Scott Sources: \\n\\nCISA: https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/03/06/defending-against-covid-19-cyber-scams \\n\\nICC: https://www.icc-ccs.org/index.php/1288-coronavirus-investment-fraud-and-cyber-scam-warnings WHO: https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/02/1058381\\n\\n2/2', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-451.docx'}),\n",

This is a toggled option and can be reset by the end-user at any time. The changes necessary to accomplish this will not be visible to you, but messages sent from outside of ABC Comp will be returned to the sender as non-deliverable.\\n\\nCaution: Configuring a mailbox, contact, or PDL with Internal-Only Email Routing could prevent expected messages from being delivered. Use this option with caution.\\n\\nUsage\\n\\nPDLs being created via POINTS | Domain & Collaboration Service | ABC Comp Email and PDL Tool has a configurable option of immediately blocking all Email sent to the PDL from outside of ABC Comp. New mailboxes and contacts will not have this option available due to a concern of inadvertently blocking business critical mail. Owners of generic mailboxes and contacts have the option to toggle blocking on at a later date via the front-end using Modify or Delete My (or Other) Accounts.\\n\\nPersonal mailboxes will not be permitted to block external mail at this time due to required receipt of ABC Comp associated email (e.g. Addison Avenue, Hewlett-Packard Stock Options, Fidelity, and many others).\\n\\nUsing Internal-Only Email Routing:\\n\\nPrevents mail from outside of ABC Comp from reaching your Exchange mailbox\\n\\nCould prevent expected messages from being delivered (Use with caution)\\n\\nProperties\\n\\nConfiguring an Exchange object with Internal-Only Email Routing:\\n\\nCan be toggled on / off at any time by the object's owner\\n\\nWill prevent e-mail from being delivered to the object from anywhere outside of ABC Comp\\n\\nRecommendations\\n\\nFor Exchange mailboxes that must receive only ABC Comp-internal Email, it is highly recommended to control incoming Email by enabling Internal-Only Email Routing. Configuring a mailbox, contact, or PDL with Internal-Only Email Routing could prevent expected messages from being delivered.\\n\\nHow To Establish Internal-Only Email Routing\\n\\nYou will first need to have a PDL already created before you can request for an authorization PDL.\\n\\nLogin to POINTS | Domain & Collaboration Services | ABC Comp Email and PDL | Modify or Delete My Account\\n\\nSelect the PDL you want to apply restriction using the drop down list under 'Select an account' and click Continue\\n\\nUnder 'ADVANCED PDL OPTIONS TO RESTRICT MAIL DELIVERY' | Internal-Only, select 'Check to block all Email sent to this PDL from outside of ABC Comp'\\n\\nYou will advance to the next page.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could relay user credentials and use them to execute code on the target system.\\n\\nCredSSP is an authentication provider which processes authentication requests for other applications; any application which depends on CredSSP for authentication may be vulnerable to this type of attack.\\n\\nAs an example of how an attacker would exploit this vulnerability against Remote Desktop Protocol, the attacker would need to run a specially crafted application and perform a man-in-the-middle attack against a Remote Desktop Protocol session. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\\n\\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Credential Security Support Provider protocol (CredSSP) validates requests during the authentication process.\\n\\nTo be fully protected against this vulnerability users must enable Group Policy settings on their systems and update their Remote Desktop clients. The Group Policy settings are disabled by default to prevent connectivity problems and users must follow the instructions documented HERE to be fully protected.\\n\\nhttps://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-0886\\n\\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0886\\n\\n1/1', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-542.docx'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='[EXO] How to prepare and what to expect for the upcoming mailbox migration to O365\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nShirley Sim\\n\\n3/29/17 10:05 AM | Last Updated 3/31/20 10:16 PM\\n\\nABC Comp IT will commence user email migration to the Office 365 enterprise cloud solution environment between April and June 2017. Here is a summary of how you can prepare and what you can expect for the upcoming transition.Note. While we are on a hybrid or mixed-mode environment where some user mailboxes are already migrated to the O365 cloud, while some other mailboxes are still hosted on the on-premise Exchange mail servers, there may be some limitations with Outlook usage and how the entire O365 services e.g. Exchange Online Protection (for Email Hygiene) and Advanced Threat Protection (for Malware protection) work until all mailboxes are completely migrated to the O365 cloud.\\n\\nABC Comp IT will provide as much information as possible to help users transition to O365 and sharing with you the potential features that may temporarily not work as expected until the whole company is moved to O365.\\n\\nUser Mailbox Migration Schedule Planning\\n\\nABC Comp IT will prepare and batch mailboxes based on Microsoft best practices and recommendations. Each batch will contain user and generic (shared) mailboxes from all 3 regions (Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific).The entire transition over to the O365 environment for each user or mailbox consists of 3 phases:\\n\\nMailbox Replication (performed on the background with no user impact)\\n\\nMailbox Migration (a cutover from on-prem to cloud where the O365 settings get applied to the mailboxes)\\n\\nMailbox Go-Live (projected date and time where the user is able to start using the O365 email - timings vary and may happen earlier for some users within the scheduled batch)\\n\\nUser Communications on Migration Schedule\\n\\nPrior to a user communication being sent to mailbox owners, mailbox replication for the various batch of mailboxes will be scheduled and performed on the backend by ABC Comp IT and Microsoft team. This action will be completely transparent to the users and have no impact to your continual use of your on-premise email.\\n\\nYou will receive a user communication 5 days before your scheduled migration and go-live date to prepare you for the upcoming migration. A sample of the message can be viewed here.\\n\\nKindly read the entire message when you receive your migration notice and take the appropriate actions as outlined in the user communications pre and post migration to O365.\\n\\nWhat to Expect - Your new O365 mailbox and limitations in a hybrid / mixed-mode environment\\n\\nPost-migration items to note:\\n\\nDesktop Client Users using Outlook 2016: There will be no change to how you access e-mail whether on ABC Comp network while in the office or on a VPN Connection. \\n\\nIf you are still on Office 2010 or Office 2013, you need to upgrade to Office 2016 in order to be able to access your O365 Email. Instructions for upgrade to Office 2016 can be found here. Alternatively, login to Okta, select the Office 365 chicklet. You will see an Install Office 2016 button on the top right of the page.\\n\\nNote - In order to access O365 Email using Outlook 2013, you must be on minimum version 15.0.4753.1001 for Office 2013 to be able to connect.\\n\\nMac OS Users using Outlook 2016: Update your Outlook settings to access your O365 e-mail by following the instructions here. Otherwise, you will be unable to send/receive e-mail until the settings have been updated.\\n\\nInternet Browser OWA Users: Your OWA login page URL https://mail.keysight.com/owa/ will be changed and redirected to a new URL: http://outlook.com/owa/keysight.com\\n\\nIf you are accessing via Okta, you will need to access via the Okta chicklets \"Microsoft Office 365 Mail\" or \"Microsoft Office 365 Mail Tile.\\n\\nMobility Email: If you were accessing your ABC Comp Email (via Mobile Iron & Activesync) using the native ‘Mail’ application on your mobile devices, you will no longer be able to check your O365 mail using this method.\\n\\n To access your O365 Email from a mobile device, you may use the Outlook Mobile Application to access your new O365 mailbox and calendar from your iOS, Android or Windows devices. Instructions are available here.\\n\\nPersonal Folders: Your Personal Folders (PST files) resides on your PCs and will not be migrated to your O365 Exchange Online Mailbox. You will continue to have access to them through your Outlook client on your desktop as you have done in the past.\\n\\nGeneric Mailbox Access: If you have full mailbox access to a Generic mailbox previously, you should continue to have access to the on-premise Generic mailbox which is waiting to be migrated to O365. If you have issues accessing or sending from the Generic mailbox, please follow this workaround until the Generic mailbox is migrated to O365 in the weeks to come.\\n\\nDelegate Access, Send-on-Behalf, Send-As & Folder Permissions: Using Microsoft best practices and migration analysis tool, ABC Comp IT will schedule the migration of user mailboxes with possible associations to other mailboxes such as delegates and send-on-behalf permissions. However, this is not always possible. These permissions will start to work again once all associated mailboxes are migrated to O365 eventually. ABC Comp IT requests the kind understanding and patience of users if your access is temporarily broken during the migration period.\\n\\nMailbox Size Limits: Your new O365 mailbox size is 100 GB. However, note that Microsoft is currently in the process of updating and increasing from 50GB to 100GB for all their customers including ABC Comp. If you see your mailbox size displaying as 50GB, it may take weeks before it is bumped up to 100GB eventually. Read about other limits that will be applied to your O365 mailbox.\\n\\nAdvanced Threat Protection (ATP): A new additional security feature that is part of the O365 service subscription will be introduced and enabled on user\\'s mailboxes as they are migrated to O365. Read about this feature to be familiar in preparation for your migration to O365. Find out more about safe links and URL rewrites that may occur in email you received. ABC Comp will be enabling Dynamic Delivery on 21 July to mitigate mail delivery delay due to ATP attachment scanning. Find out more.\\n\\nArchive mailbox and In-Place archiving: A new feature that is part of the O365 service subscription to be introduced shortly. Additional information will be shared by ABC Comp IT as we work through the transition to O365.\\n\\nSingle Sign-On (SSO) / Authentication: Single Sign-on authentication may change for Office 365 apps in the weeks to come as we replace Okta with Azure AD & Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) in ABC Comp. Changing the SSO for Office 365 apps and implementing ADFS/Conditional Access will be the first step and allow users to be able to access to your Office 365 data inside and outside of the company network in a secure manner. When accessing your Office 365 data outside of the company network you will be required to enter a second factor for authentication (MFA).  If you have not already set up your MFA preferences, please find detailed instructions in the article in Self-Help Portal\\n\\nOther applications which are currently available in Okta will eventually and over time be migrated over to the new SSO solution. Additional information will be shared by ABC Comp IT as we work through the transition to O365.\\n\\nPDL Membership Update: Do you have an issue with updating PDLs via Outlook Address Book after migrating to O365? ABC Comp IT has provided a workaround while we are in a hybrid environment where cloud write-up is currently disabled and users are still progressively getting migrated to the O365 environment.\\n\\nPhish Alarm: Phish Alarm is a Microsoft Outlook Add-in that allows employees to report suspicious phishing email easily. \\n\\nNote that the <Report Phish> button may look different depending on the Outlook client version. When you receive a suspected phishing email, simple click on the button. The email will be forwarded to the IT cyber security team, together with all the information needed to determine if the email reported is a real phishing attack. The cyber security team will then advise you accordingly. For more information visit here\\n\\nHow to get help and support with O365\\n\\nTransiting to a new platform and environment can seem challenging and daunting in the beginning. ABC Comp IT aims to provide as much assistance as the company embarks on this new learning journey with new technology, new tools, new features and functionalities.\\n\\nIf you encounter issues and require IT Support, please as a first step, to always log a ticket with the IT Help Desk. This will ensure your issue is dispatched to the appropriate and correct team for investigation and followup.\\n\\nIf you are unable to access your email using the regular Outlook client after your migration to O365, please consider accessing your email via Webmail as a temporary workaround until you get your Outlook access to O365 fixed on your client. Alternatively, you may access the Mail Tile in the My Apps portal (https://myapps.microsoft.com)\\n\\nFor questions regarding the Microsoft O365 Enterprise Cloud Solution program, please visit the website\\n\\n(http://it.keysight.com/o365cloud) or send email to: o365-mscloud-program@ABC Comp.com', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-642.docx'}),\n",

What should I do?\\n\\n Top | \\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\nGeneral Questions and Answers\\n\\nQ. What is SCCM?\\n\\nA.  SCCM (System Center Configuration Management) is a systems-management software product developed by Microsoft for managing large groups of computers. SCCM provides software distribution and management for Client PCs. Top |\\n\\nInstallation Questions and Answers\\n\\nQ. How do I install SCCM?\\n\\nA.  To install SCCM on a client running a supported Operating System follow below instructions.\\n\\nSCCM Agent Installation \\n\\nThe SCCM Agent should be already installed on a PC that was setup by the standard CLM PC Setup process. If the SCCM agent is not installed (e.g. reusing a PC obtained from acquisition), use the procedure below to install the SCCM agent. Please ensure the PC meets the requirements before proceeding. Also note that SCCM CANNOT be installed on non-ABC Comp provided PC (e.g. DO NOT install SCCM on personal PC or third party owned PC) \\n\\nTo install the SCCM agent:\\n\\nPlease copy the appropriate SCCM agent installation binaries from the below shared drives to local machine based on your region.\\n\\n\\\\\\\\euctools.it.ABC Comp.com\\\\SCCMAgent\\n\\nSCCM Client Binaries – America (Client machines based in America)\\n\\nSCCM Client Binaries – APAC (Client machines based in Asia Pacific region)\\n\\nSCCM Client Binaries – EMEA (Client machines based in EMEA region) \\n\\nExecute “ccmsetup.exe” from the binaries copied to your local machine The SCCM Client Installer will begin installing the SCCM client.\\n\\nYou must have Administrator permissions to the folder to access the client installation files. CCMSetup.exe copies all necessary installation prerequisites to the client computer and starts the client installation. \\n\\nPlease allow some time for the installation to finish and verify the SCCM client availability in Start | All Programs | Microsoft System Center | Configuration Manager | Software Center.\\n\\nSince the installation will happen in silent mode, you will not see the installation progress.\\n\\nTop | \\n\\nQ. Can you tell me how much time it will take to install SCCM?\\n\\nA.  Our experience is that it takes about from 5 to 10 minutes to install the SCCM client depending on the network traffic at the time of installation.\\n\\nTop | \\n\\nQ. Which Operating Systems can the SCCM client be installed on and what the PC requirement?\\n\\nA.  \\n\\nPC requirements for SCCM installation\\n\\nWindows 7\\n\\nWindows 8 (or 8.1)\\n\\nWindows 10\\n\\nIn order to use SCCM, the PC must satisfy the following criteria and policies:\\n\\nThe PC must be a ABC Comp asset (owned/leased) - SCCM and software being delivered by SCCM are licensed for use on\\n\\nABC Comp PCs only; personally owned or third-party PCs cannot install and use SCCM.\\n\\nThe PC is joined to the ABC Comp domain - SCCM uses ABC Comp Active Directory for authentication and application provisioning. PCs not in the ABC Comp domain will NOT be able to install SCCM (Note: CLM PC by default is joined to the ABC Comp domain and is pre-installed with SCCM).\\n\\nThe PC regularly connects to the ABC Comp network (VPN ok) - SCCM is targeted for ABC Comp PCs being used in the ABC Comp environment only. If the ABC Comp PC is NOT being used in the ABC Comp infrastructure (e.g. PC is mainly used at a customer site without connectivity to the ABC Comp network), it is not suitable to be managed by SCCM.\\n\\nOffline PCs (e.g. spare PCs, PCs reserved for emergency use etc.) must be turn on and connected to the ABC Comp network at least once a month - PCs managed by SCCM must check in at least once a month to ensure it is current with patches and updates in order to stay compliant with IT Security requirements.\\n\\nThe PC is running Windows 10, Windows 8 or Windows 7 operating system with minimum 1GB of memory (RAM) and 60GB of disk space - The current CLM hardware offering should meet this system requirement.\\n\\nTop | \\n\\nQ. Can SCCM be installed on Windows 2000 Clients?\\n\\nA.  No.  ABC Comp does not support SCCM on Windows 2000 clients.\\n\\nTop | \\n\\nOperation/Usage Questions\\n\\nQ.  How do I install a package from SCCM?\\n\\nA.  To install a package from SCCM, launch the SCCM Software Center available in the following location on your PC:\\n\\n\\t\\tStart      | All Programs | Microsoft System Center | Configuration      Manager | Software Center\\n\\n                                                                         Or\\n\\n\\t\\tClick on the Software Center icon available on your PC      Task bar.\\n\\n\\t\\tClick on an application in the list and click on Install      button available in lower right corner of Software Center.\\n\\nTop | \\n\\nQ.  Can I select and install multiple applications at the same time via SCCM?\\n\\nA.  Yes, in SCCM you can select multiple applications for installation.  To do this, navigate to the Applications tab, select the checkbox for each application you want to install. Next, open the Application and Install.\\n\\nTop | \\n\\nQ.  How do I manually apply an SCCM Machine Policy cycle?\\n\\nA.  To manually apply an SCCM \"Machine Connect,\" do the following:\\n\\n\\t\\tGo to Start | Control Panel | Configuration      Manager Properties\\n\\nNavigate to actions tab in Configuration Manager Properties, select below actions and click on run under Actions. \\n\\nApplication Deployment Evaluation Cycle\\n\\nMachine Policy Retrieval and Evaluation Cycle\\n\\nDepending on what is installed, this process can take from 5-10 minutes.\\n\\nTop | \\n\\nQ.  How do I manually apply an SCCM Patch updates (software update cycle)?\\n\\nA.  To manually apply an SCCM \"Patch Connect,\" do the following:\\n\\n\\t\\tGo to Start | Control Panel | Configuration      Manager Properties\\n\\nNavigate to actions tab in Configuration Manager Properties, select below actions and click on run under Actions. \\n\\nApplication Deployment Evaluation Cycle\\n\\nMachine Policy Retrieval and Evaluation Cycle\\n\\nSoftware Updates Deployment Evaluation Cycle\\n\\nSoftware Updates Scan Cycle\\n\\nDepending on what is installed, this process can take from 5-10 minutes.\\n\\nTop | \\n\\nQ.  What is the SCCM reboot schedule?\\n\\nA.  There is no SCCM reboot schedule.  Reboots will be prompted whenever something is installed or updated that requires a reboot, e.g., to complete an application or security patch installation.\\n\\nThe most common changes that require reboots are Microsoft Security Patches. These are, typically, released once a month.  Currently, SCCM checks for Security Patch updates on Thursday (this may change in the future).  Thus, if a security patch is installed that requires a reboot, it will be prompted on a Thursday.\\n\\nHowever, if your PC has not been connected to the ABC Comp network for more than 9 days, SCCM will check for any Security Patch updates when you connect to the ABC Comp network (regardless of what day of the week it is).  Depending on what is installed, this could prompt a reboot.\\n\\nTop | \\n\\nQ. SCCM does not list the application I need to install. What should I do?\\n\\nA.  In general if an application is not visible in SCCM, then that application is not available through SCCM.  Some applications are only provided to a specific group of users.  You will need to contact the provider of these applications to get added to the group.\\n\\nPlease note: Not all applications being used in ABC Comp are available through the Software Lifecycle Management (SLM) software distribution solution.  If there is an application that is not available through SLM, then you should work with your manager to determine the best method to procure it.\\n\\nTop | ', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-664.docx'}),\n",

Z)\\n\\nLower-Case Letters (a, b, c, ... z)\\n\\nNumbers (0, 1, 2, ... 9)\\n\\nSpecial Characters (!,$,#,%).\\n\\nHow to Select Good Password?\\n\\n\\tPassword must not contain the user's entire Account Name or entire Full Name. The Account Name and Full Name are parsed for delimiters: commas, periods, dashes or hyphens, underscores, spaces, pound signs, and tabs. If any of these delimiters are found, the Account Name or Full Name are split and all sections are verified not to be included in the password.\\n\\nThere is no check for any character or any three characters in succession. \\n\\nDo not reuse the same password. Do not re-used the same password with only amending couple of characters.\\n\\nChoose random words\\n\\nPick three random words e.g.: Jar Tea Phone\\n\\nChoose a date that is easy to recall e.g.: 2009\\n\\nPut the words together e.g.: jarteaphone\\n\\nSplit the date up and put it at the start and end e.g.: 20jarteaphone09\\n\\nCapitalise a letter in each word e.g.: 20JarTeaPhone09\\n\\nAdd two special characters to the end e.g.: 20JarTeaPhone09!!\\n\\nUse the sentence. This could be a summary of a significant event, a description of your favourite place or the first difficult sentence you learned in a new language.\\n\\nIntroduce two or more numbers, dots, ampersands, other special characters or spaces in your password. Do not go for obvious, such as “!” mark in the end or beginning or “a” with “@”. Add the special characters in the middle of the password or replace the words with numbers, i.e, “for” with “4”\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/26/2020\\n\\nDo not used patterns. Do not use character patterns, i.e. Aaaaaaaaaaaa, AbcDEFGHiJKL, Qwertyuiopas, 1234567890 and etc.\\n\\nDo not used words/phrases which could be easily socially engineered. Try to avoid having reference to any information which could be socially engineered. Remember, LinkedIn is still a social network application/services, therefore, company name, project, tool or application you have been working on, can be socially engineered if it has been publicly marketed.\\n\\n\\tUsed the Random Password Generator. Online Random Password Generators will generate the sequence of random characters (letters, numbers, symbols, etc.). Password generated via Random Password Generator tool are secure, however, they might be challenging to remember, therefore, you might want start using password manager tools like KeePass.\\n\\n\\t\\tTest your password’s strength.

You have now been informed that a ABC Comp email address has been requested for you and there is this tool called Office 365 that you will need to learn and master. \\n\\nYou must be wondering \"What\\'s that and how do I get started using Office 365?\" \\n\\nStep 1.    Ensure you have received your Windows AD Account and credentials.\\nStep 2.    Set up your Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to allow you to sign-in to your O365 tools and services securely.\\nStep 3.    Your ABC Comp PC may have come installed with Office applications - Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook. Otherwise, you can login to the O365 portal on https://portal.office.com . The main page includes an Install Office 2016 link for you to download and install the latest version of Office application available in our ABC Comp O365 subscription.\\nStep 4.    Once installation completes, activate your Office 365 product.\\nStep 5.    Read about the Office 365 features and workloads enabled on your Office 365 Enterprise E3 license.\\nStep 6.    Create an Outlook profile to access your Office 365 Email. Alternatively, you can use Outlook on the Web as a quick alternative method for checking email.\\nStep 7.    If you have a corporate or personally owned mobile device, you can set up your mobile device to access to O365 apps on the go. Device types:  iOS  Android\\nStep 8.    To learn and use O365 Collaboration tools e.g. SharePoint Online, Yammer, One Drive for Business, Teams, Groups etc. Get started here\\n\\nNote. If your email address has been created prior to your Effective Start Date, it will not show up in the Outlook Address Book until your effective start date. This is by design. However, an Outlook profile can still be created for your email address if the user setting it up has information of your Windows AD Account username, credentials and ABC Comp Email address. \\n\\nIt is the responsibility of the manager to ensure the new hire changes to a new set of Windows AD account credentials when the new hire is fully onboard after Day 1.\\n\\n1/1', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-96.docx'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='How to calculate license requirement for MS SQL Server Database?\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nTCS Database Team\\n\\n9/26/16 10:38 PM | Last Updated 3/30/20 9:33 PM\\n\\nPlease go through document below:\\n\\nSQL Server 2012 Licensing Datasheet & FAQ Published: March 7, 2012\\n\\nProduct Overview SQL Server 2012 is a significant product release, providing Mission Critical Confidence with greater uptime, blazing-fast performance and enhanced security features for mission critical workloads; Breakthrough Insight with managed self-service data exploration and stunning interactive data visualization capabilities; Cloud On Your Terms by enabling the creation and extension of solutions across on-premises and public cloud.  SQL Server 2012 is a Cloud Ready Information Platform.\\n\\nEditions overview\\n\\nThe SQL Server 2012 Editions have been streamlined to better align with how customers are deploying applications and solutions.  SQL Server 2012 will be released in 3 main editions*:\\n\\nEnterprise for mission critical applications and large scale data warehousing\\n\\nBusiness Intelligence, a new product edition, providing premium corporate and self-service BI Standard for basic database, reporting and analytics capabilities\\n\\nThe main editions are now offered in a consistent, tiered model which creates greater consistency across editions, features and licensing. Enterprise Edition will include all features available in SQL Server 2012. The Business Intelligence Edition will include premium BI features as well as all of the Standard Edition features.\\n\\nNote: SQL Server 2012 will continue to be available in Developer, Express and Compact editions.\\n\\nWeb Edition will be offered in a Services Provider License Agreement (SPLA) model only. Datacenter Edition is being retired with all capabilities now available in Enterprise. Workgroup and Small business Editions are also being retired.\\n\\nSQL Server 2012 Licensing Options\\n\\nSQL Server 2012 will continue to offer two licensing options – one based on computing power, and one based on users or devices.  In the computing power-based license model, however, the way we measure power will shift from processors to cores.  Core-based licensing provides a more precise measure of computing power and a more consistent licensing metric regardless of where the solution is deployed across on-premises, virtual and cloud scenarios.\\n\\nEnterprise Edition (EE) will be licensed based on compute capacity measured in cores Business Intelligence (BI) Edition will be available in the Server + CAL model, based on users or devices\\n\\nStandard Edition(SE) offers both licensing models to address basic database workloads\\n\\n*Pricing is for demonstrative uses only\\n\\nCore-Based Licensing\\n\\nThe Enterprise Edition and Standard Edition of SQL Server 2012 will both be available under core-based licensing. Core-based licenses will be sold in two-core packs. \\n\\nCore based licensing is appropriate when customers are unable to count users/devices, have Internet/Extranet facing workloads or systems that integrate with external facing workloads. To license a physical server, you must license all the cores in the server with a minimum of 4 core licenses required for each physical processor in the server. \\n\\nCore licenses will be priced at ¼ the cost of a SQL Server 2008 R2 (EE/SE) processor license. AMD systems have different requirements; see SQL Server 2012 Quick Reference Guide.\\n\\nHow to license\\n\\nLicense all of the physical cores on the hardware\\n\\nA minimum of 4 core licenses are required per physical processor\\n\\nPHYSICAL\\n\\nCORES IN\\t    1          2           4            6        \\n\\nTHE\\t    8\\n\\nPROCESSOR:\\n\\nCORE LICENSES REQUIRED\\n\\n    4          4           4            6        \\n\\n    8\\n\\nServer and Client Access License (CAL) Licensing\\n\\nThe Business Intelligence and Standard Editions will be available under the Server and Client Access License (CAL) model. \\n\\nThis licensing model can be used when the number of users can be readily counted (e.g., internal database applications). \\n\\nTo access a licensed SQL Server, each user must have a SQL Server CAL that is the same version or newer (for example, to access a SQL Server 2008 SE server, a user would need a SQL Server 2008 or 2012 CAL). \\n\\n Each SQL Server CAL can provide access to multiple licensed SQL Servers, including the new Business Intelligence Edition as well as Standard Edition Servers and legacy Enterprise Edition Servers.\\n\\nThe SQL Server 2012 CAL price will increase by about 27%.\\n\\nHow to license\\n\\nLicense each individual server with a SQL Server license\\n\\nLicense each user or device accessing the server with a SQL Server CAL\\n\\nSQL Server 2012 CALs can be used to access any SQL Server database licensed per server, regardless of platform or edition.\\n\\nVirtualization Licensing - Cloud Optimized\\n\\nSQL Server 2012 will offer expanded virtualization rights, options and benefits to provide greater flexibility for customers deploying in virtual environments. There will be two primary virtualization licensing options in SQL Server 2012: The ability to license individual virtual machines and the ability to license for maximum virtualization in highly virtualized and private cloud environments.\\n\\nIndividual Virtual Machines\\n\\nAs hardware capabilities grow, it will become more common for each database to use a fraction of its server’s computing power. \\n\\nWhen deploying databases on Virtual Machines (VMs) that use just a fraction of a physical server, savings can be achieved by licensing individual VMs.\\n\\nTo license a VM with core licenses, purchase a core license for each virtual core (virtual thread) allocated to the virtual machine (minimum of 4 core licenses per VM). \\n\\nTo license a single VM with a server license (for Business Intelligence or Standard only), buy the server license and buy matching SQL Server CALs for each user.\\n\\nEach licensed VM covered with Software Assurance (SA) can be moved frequently within a server farm or to a third party hoster or cloud services provider without buying additional SQL Server licenses. \\n\\nHow to License VMs with Core Licenses\\n\\nLicense the virtual cores in each virtual machine\\n\\nThere is a minimum of 4 core licenses required for each virtual machine\\n\\nVM1\\tVM2\\n\\nVM with 4 Virtual Cores\\n\\nVM with 6 Virtual Cores\\n\\n4 Core licenses\\n\\n6 Core licenses required required\\n\\nHow to License VMs with Server + CAL\\n\\nLicense each VM with a Server License\\n\\nLicense each user or device with a CAL\\n\\nVM1\\tVM2\\n\\nVM with SQL Server\\n\\nVM with SQL Server\\n\\nBusiness Intelligence\\n\\nStandard Edition\\n\\nEdition\\n\\n1 Server license required\\n\\n1 Server license\\n\\n+ CALs required + CALs\\n\\nHigh Density Virtualization\\n\\n Further savings can be achieved by operating a database server utility or SQL Server private cloud. This is a great option for customers who want to take advantage of the full computing power of their physical servers and have very dynamic provisioning and de-provisioning of virtual resources.\\n\\nCustomers will be able to deploy an unlimited number of VM’s on the server and utilize the full capacity of the licensed hardware.\\n\\nThey can do so by fully licensing the server (or server farm) with Enterprise Edition core licenses and Software Assurance based on the total number of physical cores on the servers.  SA then enables the ability to run an unlimited number of virtual machines to handle dynamic workloads and fully utilize the hardware’s computing power.\\n\\n Customers cannot license for unlimited virtualization with SQL Server 2008 R2 EE Server + CAL. This was only a temporary use right grant with SA.\\n\\n Transition to the New Licensing Models\\n\\nIn order to facilitate a smooth transition to the new editions and licensing, Microsoft is offering several options. These are designed to help enable customers to plan for the future while protecting their current investments.\\n\\nEnterprise Edition Server + CAL Licensing\\n\\n New server licenses for SQL Server Enterprise Edition in the Server + Cal model will only be available for purchase through June 30th, 2012, after which they will no longer be available for purchase.  EA/EAP customers that buy SQL Enterprise Edition Servers will have until their next EA/EAP renewal after June 30th, 2012 to purchase additional server licenses to complete currently planned projects. After that, all new SQL Server Enterprise Edition deployments must be purchased per core.\\n\\n All existing SQL Server Enterprise Edition licenses under the Server + CAL model with Software Assurance current when SQL Server 2012 launches can be upgraded to SQL Server 2012 at no additional cost, and SA can be maintained (in the server + cal model) to provide access to future software updates.   These Legacy Enterprise Edition Servers remain licensed under the Server + CAL model and require the appropriate version of the SQL Server CAL for users or devices.\\n\\n Legacy SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition Server deployments licensed in the server + CAL model will be subject to a 20 core per server license maximum.  This core maximum applies both to new server licenses and to prior version server licenses upgraded to 2012 with SA.  If you purchased SQL Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Edition in the Server + CAL model with Software Assurance and at the launch of SQL Server 2012 are running on a server with > 20 physical cores, contact your Microsoft representative for help transitioning to the new licensing model.  Legacy SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition Server licenses are still considered licensed under the Server + CAL model but have the new core limit to allow customers to upgrade their existing deployments and have some near term deployment options to finish currently planned projects under the Server + CAL model for the SQL Server Enterprise Edition.\\n\\n Moving forward, customers who would have purchased new EE server licenses can: purchase SQL BI server licenses for business intelligence, purchase SQL EE per core for high-scale database or data warehouse, or maintain legacy EE server licenses for existing projects requiring 20 cores or less.\\n\\n SQL Server Processor licenses under SA moving to Core-based Licensing\\n\\n Customers with processor licenses under SA will receive rights to upgrade to SQL Server 2012 at no additional cost.  At the subsequent renewal, the customer will have the opportunity to renew into core licenses.\\n\\n SQL Enterprise and Standard processor licenses under SA are valued at a minimum of 4 core licenses per processor or the actual number of cores in use. SQL Server Datacenter processor licenses are valued at a minimum of 8 EE core licenses per processor or the actual number of cores in use.\\n\\n At the end of the current agreement term, customers should do a self-inventory of systems currently running SQL Server, documenting the number of cores in each processor in use with a SQL Server processor license covered with Software Assurance.  This will enable customers to receive the appropriate SQL Server 2012 use rights moving forward and will determine the core license exchange eligibility at renewal.\\n\\n Customers should do this self-inventory using the Microsoft Assessment and Planning (MAP) Toolkit or other inventory tools and processes to accurately archive a time/date stamped inventory of hardware tied to SQL Server installations.\\n\\n If customers do not perform the self-inventory, they will receive a value of 4 core licenses for each Standard and Enterprise Edition processor and 8 EE core licenses per Datacenter Edition processor.\\n\\n License Transition Summary\\n\\nCustomers with Enterprise Agreements\\n\\n Customers in existing Enterprise Agreements, EAPs and EASs will be able to continue to purchase processor licenses and Enterprise Edition server licenses through the end of their term.\\n\\n Customers purchasing processor licenses through the end of their term will continue to need to calculate the number of licenses required for a deployment based on the 2008 R2 processor use rights. \\n\\n Customers with an EA or EAP do have the option to add core licenses mid-term to their agreement for future purchases and should contact their reseller or Microsoft account team for more information. \\n\\nAll servers licensed with SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition server + CAL licenses will be subject to the 20 core server limitation.\\n\\nThe same process as outlined above will be followed at the end of term.\\n\\nPlanning for SQL Server 2012\\n\\nCustomers planning to deploy SQL Server 2012, either through upgrades or new licenses, should remember:\\n\\nRenewing Software Assurance (SA) is the best way to protect investments and provide access to new versions as well as Deployment Planning Services and technical assistance.\\n\\nEAP will continue to offer customers the best value, including discounts of up to 40% on new EE and BI server licenses.\\n\\nCustomers should select the right edition depending on usage:\\n\\nEnterprise for mission critical applications and large scale data warehousing\\n\\nBusiness Intelligence for premium corporate and self-service BI\\n\\nStandard for basic database, reporting and analytics capabilities\\n\\nConsolidation and virtualization are the best ways to maximize efficiency of hardware and control the size, computing power and more granularly manage cost of your deployments.\\n\\nFor additional information on Microsoft SQL Server 2012, go to the SQL Server website at: http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver\\n\\nThis guide does not supersede or replace any of the legal documentation covering SQL Server 2012 product use rights.

The Web Edition will be offered only to hosters via the Services Provider License Agreement (SLPA).  Developer, Express and Compact Editions will also continue to be distributed without licensing or pricing changes.  We also offer a range of appliances including Parallel Data Warehouse, a BI appliance, and a database consolidation appliance.\\n\\nSQL Server 2012 Licensing\\n\\n5.What are the key licensing changes with SQL Server 2012?\\n\\nWith SQL Server 2012, we will offer the following licensing options:\\n\\nCore-based Licensing for Enterprise\\n\\nServer + CAL licensing for Business Intelligence\\n\\nChoice of core-based licensing or Server + CAL licensing for Standard\\n\\n6.When will these changes come into effect?\\n\\nLicensing changes will come into effect at the general availability of SQL Server 2012.  Microsoft SQL Server 2012 will release on April 1st, 2012. \\n\\n7.Are there any virtualization or cloud-related licensing benefits with SQL Server 2012?\\n\\nSQL Server 2012 will provide a variety of virtualization and cloud benefits that will help customers save money on database licensing and retain flexibility in their database deployments.  Customers can:\\n\\nLicense individual Virtual Machines (VM), and when licensing per core, buy core licenses only for the virtual cores (threads or physical cores) assigned to the VM.\\n\\nLicense for high VM density by buying EE core licenses and Software Assurance (SA) for all the physical cores on the server (or server farm) and deploying any number of VMs on the licensed hardware.  Without SA, VM density is limited to one VM per core with EE.\\n\\n License for VM mobility across private and public clouds.  VM license mobility is an SA benefit.  Without SA, licenses can be moved from one server to another only once every 90 days. \\n\\n8.Could you explain why you are making these changes?\\n\\nThe changes to SQL Server licensing reflect the evolution of the database industry along with new hardware deployment practices.  Internal customer research with hundreds of customers has shown us that database customers are comfortable with core-based licensing and consider licensing by core simple and predictable.  There is also great enthusiasm for our virtualization and cloud-friendly licensing to help customers save money as their deployment practices evolve.  With these changes, we will continue to offer industry leading TCO.\\n\\n9.Will other Microsoft products move to core-based licensing as well?\\n\\nWe have put in place licensing models that are appropriate for the products based on industry and customer needs. The changes to SQL Server licensing are based on trends in the database industry and were developed with just the database business in mind. \\n\\n10.Will the licensing changes be accompanied by an increase in pricing?\\n\\nWith SQL Server 2012, we are delivering a more powerful Enterprise Edition and a new Business Intelligence Edition with innovative features.  SQL Server customers who benefit from the new capabilities and who deploy mission critical databases will likely pay more, though we will continue to be the industry TCO leader.\\n\\nAt the same time, we are offering licensing benefits and flexibility to help customers save money and control costs with virtualization and consolidation.  The net price impact to individual customers will vary based on how they deploy SQL Server 2012, their current capacity and their future needs. \\n\\nWe have been actively engaged in conversations directly with our customers and partners to ensure that they know how these changes may impact them.\\n\\n11.Can I buy core-based licensing for the Business Intelligence edition?\\n\\nEnterprise Edition includes the full capabilities of SQL Server 2012, so a customer who wants to license a BI Server on a per core basis can do so by buying Enterprise Edition.  Enterprise Edition will be the preferred way to license advanced SQL Server BI capabilities when users are uncountable (e.g., external facing workloads) or when there is a very large number of users.\\n\\n12.Can I use the same CAL for the Business Intelligence and Standard editions?\\n\\nYes, as with prior releases, there is a single CAL for SQL Server 2012 for access to all the server editions.\\n\\n13.I have Software Assurance, do I have to pay more to upgrade to SQL Server 2012?\\n\\nNo. All licenses under SA will be able to upgrade to SQL Server 2012 at no additional cost.\\n\\n14.I recently signed up for an Enterprise Agreement (EA)/Enrollment for Application Platform (EAP).  What do these changes mean for me?\\n\\nEA and EAP remain the best ways for customers to license SQL Server.  EA and EAP offer extended transitions to help you plan for the new licensing model.  Furthermore, EAP offers significant discounts to help you take advantage of the lowest TCO. \\n\\n15.How do I migrate from processor licenses to core licenses?  What is the migration path?\\n\\nLicenses purchased with Software Assurance (SA) will upgrade to SQL Server 2012 at no additional cost.\\n\\n EA/EAP customers can continue buying processor licenses until your next renewal after April 1st, 2012.  At the next renewal, processor licenses will be eligible to be renewed into core-based licenses sufficient to cover the cores in use by the processor-licensed databases (minimum of 4 cores per processor for Standard and Enterprise, and minimum of 8 Enterprise cores per processor for Datacenter).\\n\\n16.How will SQL Server processor licenses with SA be exchanged for SQL Server 2012 core licenses? How will I (and Microsoft) determine the number of cores that I am owed?\\n\\nYou can perform a “self-inventory” of your environment at the end of your Software Assurance (SA) term that will provide the basis for your long term SQL Server 2012 use rights and eligibility for renewal into core licenses.  We will provide access to the Microsoft Assessment and Planning (MAP) Toolkit as one way to help track and document deployments.  This tool can help you plan the transition from processor-based licenses to core-based licenses by counting both processors and cores across your deployments.  If you are not able to document your SQL Server deployments, then your processors will be worth the standard conversion ratio by edition.  We encourage you to work with your Microsoft or Partner representative to determine an optimal transition plan.', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-792.docx'}),\n",

Outlook add-ins have three key aspects:\\n\\nThe same add-in and business logic work across desktop (Outlook on Windows and Mac), web (Office 365 and Outlook.com), and mobile.\\n\\nOutlook add-ins consist of a manifest, which describes how the add-in integrates into Outlook (for example, a button or a task pane), and JavaScript/HTML code, which makes up the UI and business logic of the add-in.\\n\\n Outlook add-ins can be acquired from AppSource or sideloaded by end-users or administrators.\\n\\nOutlook add-ins are different from COM or VSTO add-ins, which are older integrations specific to Outlook running on Windows. Unlike COM add-ins, Outlook add-ins don't have any code physically installed on the user's device or Outlook client. For an Outlook add-in, Outlook reads the manifest and hooks up the specified controls in the UI, and then loads the JavaScript and HTML. The web components all run in the context of a browser in a sandbox.\\n\\nThe Outlook items that support add-ins include email messages, meeting requests, responses and cancellations, and appointments. Each Outlook add-in defines the context in which it is available, including the types of items and if the user is reading or composing an item.\\n\\nOutlook add-in integration flow\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/26/2020\\n\\n2/2\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-430.docx'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"[EXO] Enabling of Office 365 Unlimited Online Archiving Feature\\n\\nCreated by Shirley Sim\\n\\n3/16/18 4:55 AM | Last Updated 3/31/20 9:46 PM\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nABC Comp IT will enable a feature in Office 365 known as unlimited archiving for all Email users effective Friday 16 March 2018 across the company. This feature will be enabled for all users who have been assigned an Office 365 E3 license. This is a backend change which will not have any impact to you at the point of implementation. However, ABC Comp IT recommends that you read this article to understand and familiarize with this new feature.\\n\\nIn Office 365, archive mailboxes provide users with additional mailbox storage space. After a user's archive mailbox is enabled, up to 100 GB of additional storage is available. Now, when the storage quota in the archive mailbox is reached, Office 365 automatically increases the size of the archive by auto-expanding the archive with additional archives, each of size 100 GB.\\n\\nHow auto-expanding archiving works\\n\\nEnabling the unlimited online archiving will allow additional mailbox storage space to be created when a user's archive mailbox is enabled. When auto-expanding archiving is enabled, Office 365 periodically checks the size of the archive mailbox. When an archive mailbox gets close to its storage limit, Office 365 automatically creates additional storage space for the archive. If the user runs out of this additional storage space, Office 365 adds more storage space to the user's archive. This entire process happens automatically without intervention from ABC Comp IT or the End User.\\n\\nHere's a quick overview of the process.\\n\\nArchiving is enabled for a user mailbox or a shared mailbox. An archive mailbox with 100 GB of storage space is created. \\n\\nAn administrator enables auto-expanding archiving for the mailbox. Then, when the archive mailbox (including the Recoverable Items folder) reaches 90 GB, it's converted to an auto-expanding archive, and Office 365 adds storage space to the archive.\\n\\nNote that it can take up to 30 days for the additional storage space to be provisioned.\\n\\nOffice 365 automatically adds more storage space to the archive when necessary.\\n\\nWhat gets moved to the additional archive storage space?\\n\\nTo make efficient use of auto-expanding archive storage, folders might get moved. Office 365 determines which folders get moved when additional storage is added to the archive. When a folder is moved, a subfolder is automatically created under the original folder in the archive portion of the folder list in Outlook. This new subfolder points to the items that were moved. The naming convention that Office 365 uses to name this folder is _yyyy (Created on mmm dd, yyyy h_mm), where: yyyy is the year the messages in the folder were received.\\n\\nmmm dd, yyyy h_m is the date and time that the subfolder was created by Office 365, in UTC format, based on the user's time zone and regional settings in Outlook.\\n\\nBefore additional storage is added\\n\\nFolder list of archive mailbox before auto-expanding archive is provisioned\\n\\nAfter additional storage is added\\n\\nFolder list of archive mailbox after auto-expanding archive is provisioned\\n\\nOutlook requirements for accessing items in an auto-expanded archive\\n\\nTo access messages that are stored in an auto-expanded archive, users have to use one of the following Outlook clients:\\n\\nOutlook 2016 for Windows\\n\\nOutlook on the web\\n\\nOutlook 2016 for Mac\\n\\nNote: Outlook 2013 users can only access items that were originally stored in their archive mailbox. They won't be able to access items that are moved to additional archive storage.\\n\\nHere are some things to consider when using Outlook or Outlook on the web to access messages stored in an auto-expanded archive.\\n\\nYou can access any folder in your archive mailbox, including ones that were moved to the auto-expanded storage area.\\n\\nYou can search for items that were moved to an additional storage area only by searching the folder itself. This means you have to select the archive folder in the folder list to select the Current Folder option as the search scope. Similarly, if a folder in an auto-expanded storage area contains subfolders, you have to search each subfolder separately. \\n\\nItem counts in Outlook and Read/Unread counts (in Outlook and Outlook on the web) in an auto-expanded archive might not be accurate.\\n\\nYou can delete items in a subfolder that points to an auto-expanded storage area, but the folder itself can't be deleted.\\n\\nYou can't use the Recover Deleted Items feature to recover an item that was deleted from an auto-expanded storage area.\\n\\nABC Comp Retention Policies\\n\\nRetention Policies    Items older than 90 days in Outlook Junk E-mail Folder will be deleted\\n                      Email in Primary Mailbox older than 5 years (1825 days) will be moved to Online Archive\\n                      Items in your Recoverable Items Folder older than 14 days will be moved to Online Archive\\nRetention Tags        User - 1 Month Delete\\n                      User - 1 Year Archive\\n                      User - 1 Year Delete\\n                      User - 3 Years Archive\\n                      User - 5 Year Delete\\n                      User - 5 Years Archive\\n                      User - 6 Months Delete\\n                      User - Never Archive\\n                      User - Never Delete\\n\\nYou may apply retention tags to your Email messages in Outlook by right-click on the message while in the main Outlook window, and select to apply an Archive or Retention policy against the message.\\n\\nThe same can be achieved via the Outlook on the Web (browser-based email) client. \\n\\nSource: Microsoft Technet\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-501.docx'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='6/25/2020\\n\\nO365 Logon Optimization – Windows devices\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nAudrius Puikys\\n\\n3/28/19 12:50 AM | Last Updated 6/1/20 7:53 PM\\n\\nABC Comp IT has optimized O365 resource access and security by moving to ABC Comp device trust instead of trusting the network.Examples for O365 Resources; Email, SharePoint, Software as a Service (SaaS) application integrated with O365, i.e. Concur, SuccessFactors etc.\\n\\nO365 Logon Optimization\\n\\nIf you are accessing O365 resources from ABC Comp Windows device, you will NOT be prompted for Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) neither from internal or external network.\\n\\nIf you are accessing O365 resources from non-ABC Comp/Personal Windows device, you will continue to be prompted for MFA from external network, and will begin to also be prompted for MFA on the internal network. Web-based access (Outlook Web App, SharePoint Online, etc.) will be allowed. Application based access (Outlook, OneDrive, etc.) continue to be blocked.\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/25/2020\\n\\nO365 Logon Optimization – Benefits\\n\\n\\t\\tReduced amount of MFA prompts from external network.\\n\\nMicrosoft O365 authentication service, with couple of exceptions, requires obtaining access tokens per services/applications. This resulted in numerous O365 MFA verification prompts while connecting from external network. Trusting ABC Comp AD joined Windows device as a second factor reduces the number of visible MFA prompts.\\n\\n\\t\\tUnified experience from ABC Comp Internal and external to ABC Comp networks.\\n\\nAccess to ABC Comp O365 web-based and application-based resources will be identical regardless the network connections it is coming from. This will simplify access and reduce confusion especially around access from external to ABC Comp network. \\n\\nNote: Access for legacy email protocols, such as IMAP, SMTP and POP, will remain the same. Allowed on ABC Comp internal network, but blocked from external to ABC Comp network\\n\\n\\t\\tImproved O365 Sign-in monitoring\\n\\nThe improved O365 sign-in monitoring has been implemented to help to protect your O365 sign-ins even more. O365 Sign-in algorithms are monitoring and learning users normal working behavior, such as locations (IP addresses) signing from. Any abnormal/out of normal pattern behavior would require user to approve sign-in by verifying first (username/password) and second (O365 MFA) authentication factors. Successfully approved abnormal/out of normal patterns will be learnt/trusted for future use.\\n\\n Improved security by using session controls\\n\\nSession controls allow us to set how often should a user sign in again before accessing an Office 365 application or resource depending on the device that is being used and it\\'s enrollment state (managed or unmanaged by ABC Comp). These session controls act regardless of your activity or inactivity.\\n\\nO365 Logon Optimization – Known issues/limitations\\n\\n\\t\\tGoogle Chrome - Access to O365 web resources (Webmail, SharePoint, Concur, SuccessFactors etc.)\\n\\nGoogle Chrome does not pass device ID as part of authentication request, which would result in Multi-Factor Authentication prompt even on ABC Comp AD joined Windows device.\\n\\nPlease see “How to enable the Microsoft 365/Office 365 Single Sign-On (SSO) for Google Chrome web browser” IT Self Service article for workaround.\\n\\n\\t\\tRemoval of Microsoft App password.\\n\\nThe necessary back-end configuration changes require removal of Microsoft/O365 App password capabilities. Continued access requires to re-authenticate using Windows AD account password. In addition, access from external to ABC Comp network will be blocked. It continues to work from ABC Comp internal or VPN networks.\\n\\n\\t\\tError message \"You can\\'t get there from here\" for office clients(Outlook, OneDrive, Teams etc.)\\n\\nPlease see \"O365 Troubleshooting - Error “You can’t get there from here” for Office applications\" IT Self Service article for troubleshooting.\\n\\n2/2', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-115.docx'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='[EOP] How to submit spam, non-spam, and phishing scam messages to Microsoft for analysis\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nShirley Sim\\n\\n3/27/19 9:36 PM | Last Updated 3/31/20 5:54 PM\\n\\nIt can be frustrating when users in your organization receive junk messages (spam) or phishing scam messages in their Inbox, or if they don\\'t receive a legitimate email message because it\\'s marked as junk. We\\'re constantly fine-tuning our spam filters to be more accurate. You and your users can help this process by submitting false negative and false positive spam messages to Microsoft for analysis. A \"false negative\" is a spam message that should have been but was not identified as spam. A \"false positive\" is a legitimate email message that was incorrectly identified as spam.\\n\\nSubmit junk or phishing messages that passed through the spam filters\\n\\nIf you receive a message that passed through the spam filters that and should be classified as junk or a phishing scam, you can submit the \"false negative\" message to the Microsoft Spam Analysis and Microsoft Phishing Analysis teams, as appropriate. The analysts will review the message and add it to the service-wide filters if it meets the classification criteria.\\n\\nFor more spam settings that apply to the whole organization, see Block email spam with the Office 365 spam filter to prevent false negative issues. This article contains tips to help prevent false negatives.\\n\\nYou can submit junk email messages in the following ways:\\n\\n For Outlook and Outlook on the web users, use the Report Message Add-in for Microsoft Outlook. For information about how to install and use this tool, see Enable the Report Message add-in.\\n\\n You can also use email to submit messages to Microsoft that should be classified as junk or phishing scams, as described in the following procedure.\\n\\nUse email to submit junk (spam) or phishing scam messages to Microsoft\\n\\nTo submit a junk or phishing scam message to Microsoft:\\n\\nCreate a blank email message.\\n\\nAddress the message to the Microsoft team that reviews messages, as follows:\\n\\nFor junk messages: junk@office365.microsoft.com\\n\\nFor phishing scam messages: phish@office365.microsoft.com\\n\\nCopy and paste the junk or phishing scam message into the new message as an attachment.\\n\\nNote.\\n\\nYou can attach multiple messages to the new message. Make sure that all the messages are the same type — either phishing scam messages or junk email messages. > Leave the body of the new message empty.\\n\\nClick Send.\\n\\nSubmit messages that were tagged as junk but should have been allowed through\\n\\nIf a message was incorrectly identified as junk, you can submit the \"false positive\" message to the Microsoft Spam Analysis Team. The analysts will evaluate and analyze the message. Depending on the results of the analysis, the service-wide spam content filter rules may be adjusted to allow the message through.\\n\\nAdministrators can review more spam setting information that applies to a whole organization. See How to help ensure that a message isn\\'t marked as spam. This information is helpful if you have administrator-level control and you want to prevent false positives.\\n\\nYou can submit non-spam messages in the following ways:\\n\\n If you use the Move message to Junk Email folder action when you configure your content filters (this is the default action), users can release false positive messages in their Outlook or Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) Junk Email folder.\\n\\n Outlook users can release false positive messages by using the Not Junk right-click menu option. However, they must submit the message to Microsoft through email, as shown in the procedure in this article.\\n\\n Outlook on the web users can release false positive messages and submit them to Microsoft for analysis using the Mark as not junk action. For more information about how to do this, see Report junk email and phishing scams in Outlook on the web .\\n\\n If you use the Quarantine message action instead of the Move message to Junk Email folder action when you configure your content filters:\\n\\n Administrators can release spam-quarantined messages and report them as false positives from the Exchange admin center. For more information, see Find and release quarantined messages as an administrator.\\n\\n Users can release their own spam-quarantined messages and report them as false positives through the following channels:\\n\\n The Exchange admin center (EAC) user interface. For more information, see Find and Release Quarantined Messages (End Users).\\n\\n End-user spam notification messages (if they\\'re enabled by your administrator).\\n\\n You can also use email to submit messages to Microsoft that should not be classified as spam. When you do this, make sure that you use the steps in the following procedure.\\n\\nUse email to submit false positive messages\\n\\nUse the same procedure as described in the \"Use email to submit junk (spam) or phishing scam messages to Microsoft ,\" but send the message to not_junk@office365.microsoft.com.\\n\\nSpam evaluation and rules deployment\\n\\nThe spam analysis team examines messages that you submit, and adjusts the spam filters to prevent future junk mail. As a result, Office 365 spam filters areconstantly refined. Any submitted items are evaluated at the network-wide level. False positive submissions are examined and assessed for possible rule adjustment to allow future messages through the spam filters. Therefore, notifying the service of false positives and also false negatives (unfiltered spam) is advantageous for you and all customers who use the global network. The spam team examines indicators within each submitted message, such as the following:\\n\\nFrom address\\n\\nSending IP address\\n\\nKeywords\\n\\nPhrases\\n\\nFrequency of transmission Other trends and patterns\\n\\nAfter they review this information, the spam team might make changes to the service\\'s spam filtering layers.\\n\\nSpam evaluation is an ongoing process that applies regardless of the originating language or character set. Because a spam message can be vague or even lack text in the subject or message body, the spam team relies on other message characteristics to perform filtering. This means that after the spam team flags a given message as spam and makes the necessary changes to its rule base, that message will be blocked in the future until its characteristics have been modified enough to avoid our filters. New spam rules are deployed continuously. Time frames for rules on individual submissions vary depending on the quantity and quality of submissions. Because new spam rules are set globally for all customers, not all individual spam submissions will result in a new spam rule.\\n\\nReference taken from Microsoft Website', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-568.docx'}),\n",

This agreement is documented by Human Resources. \\n\\nReturning after unpaid leave\\n\\nWhen an employee returns after a period of unpaid leave, a (phone) meeting will take place between the manager and the employee to discuss changes in the business during the leave consequences of these changes and the impact on the position at that point. This will be confirmed by Human Resources. \\n\\nLeave of ≤ 3 months:\\n\\nIn normal/similar circumstances the return from leave that took place for 3 months or less a guarantee is given that the job and benefits will remain the same. \\n\\nLeave of > 3 months\\n\\nIn normal/similar circumstances there is no guarantee that the job and benefits will remain the same when returning from leave. There is a guarantee for a job, meaning there is a guarantee for a similar job with similar benefits should employee return. \\n\\nConditions\\n\\n− Employment still continues under the above conditions. \\n\\n− Holidays/ADV days are not accrued during leave. During part-time leave the accrual is pro rata to the worked hours. \\n\\n− Salary is not paid. During part-time leave the salary is paid pro rata. \\n\\n− ½ 13e month will be paid pro rata.\\n\\n− ARB will be paid pro rata. \\n\\n− Illness during full time leave the employee is not insured for the Illness Law and WIA. This means employee will not be entitled to sick pay or disability pay. \\n\\n− Illness during part-time leave the pay will be calculated over the hours worked. \\n\\n− Breaking off leave during illness can be a reason to break off the leave earlier than planned. This can occur after permission from the manager and Human Resources. The date of the first illness day can then be brought forward. \\n\\n− Unemployment  if  the  leave  is  no  longer  than  18  months,  there  are  no  consequences  for  the Unemployment Law (WW) and the leave has no effect on the amount or length of the benefit that is paid. During leave an employee is insured for unemployment. There is a separate law: Law Unpaid Leave and Social Insurances sees to this. Leave will terminate should employee become unemployed during leave.\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/26/2020\\n\\n − Health Insurance the employee is obliged to insure Health Insurance. The employee pays the insurer the nominal premium for the basic insurance (and possible supplementary insurances). ABC Comp continues to pay the employer's contribution 7.50% of salary, where a maximum salary is applied (see Variables). The additional fee of 45% of the premium for the basic insurance will lapse. \\n\\n− Company car the company car must be returned at the start of the leave period. The private contributions for extra’s cease. Should employee wish to continue use of the company car then the total lease amount needs to be reimbursed to ABC Comp. In case the employee opted for a cash allowance instead of a company car, the cash allowance will cease during the leave period. \\n\\n− Pension during full-time leave an employee has the following options:\\n\\nThe pension is shortened according to the months the employee took leave. The employee does not pay a premium.\\n\\nThe buildup of pension continues during leave at employees own expense. This means employee pays employee and employer’spension contributions. \\n\\nIn case of part-time leave the pension is built up on part-time income. \\n\\n− Disability/Surviving relative pension employee must insure these at all times.This has large consequences should the employee not insure this and he becomes disabled or dies during the leave period. The premiums will be paid by the employer as long as the leave period does not exceed 18 months. \\n\\n− Reimbursement of  telephone charges  mobile  and  telephone charges  during  leave  are  paid  by  the employee. ADSL will be paid by ABC Comp during unpaid leave except when the leave is full time early retirement. \\n\\nIn this case the subscription will be cancelled. \\n\\n− Commuting payment ceases.\\n\\n− 30% ruling special rules apply for employees with the 30% ruling dependent on the individual situation; these can be discussed on employee’s initiative with Human Resources\\n\\n2/2\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-386.docx'}),\n",

Scope:\\n\\nThis policy applies to all employees with children under nine months, regardless of their job level, length of service or hours worked. Although this right was initially intended for female employees, to protect the natural breastfeeding, now it could be enjoyed by both parents as long as they are employed/work. \\n\\nDuration:\\n\\nThe duration of this right will be extended until the nine months of the child when requesting an hour of paid time-off. When the employee decides to accumulate time-off, up to 14 full working days will be added to the extension of the maternity leave right after its termination. Part-time employees will be also entitled to full working days enjoyed in a row up to the equivalent of 112 hours; those calculations will be based on working hours within the period of nine months of the child. The employee could also partially cumulate the infant feeding care time-off period up to the 100% (from 1 up to 14 days). Infant feeding care time-off or its accumulation are compatible with the request of a leave of absence. The period of unpaid leave of absence is not eligible for “Infant feeding care time-off”. Therefore, if an employee enjoys the full paid time-off period (14 days) cumulated in full working days and afterwards, will ask for an unpaid leave of absence, an equivalent pay deduction will be applied in the payslip. Nevertheless, when an employee decides to take an unpaid LOA for child care, after the termination of the LOA, depending on the period taken, has the same alternatives as any other employee either the reduction of one hour per day, or to cumulate into full days, for the time, until the ninth month of the child, \\n\\nCo-responsibility:\\n\\n The infant feeding care could be extended with unpaid time off from the 9th to the 12th month of the baby when both parents request this extension together for the same time reduction. This can not be cumulated in full time days. This extension is unpaid.\\n\\n1/1', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-89.docx'}),\n",

However, enhanced holidays are not built up during the sick leave period.  When the employee takes holidays during the sick leave period, these holidays will be deducted from the entitlement.\\n\\nThe intention is that both legal and enhanced holidays should be taken during the course of the applicable year. With the approval of the related manager and HR the employee can be permitted to take an advance of 6 holidays of the next year. Also with the approval of the related manager and HR the employee may take unpaid leave. \\n\\nPayment of vacation not-taken during employment is possible under certain conditions. If an employee has taken at least 20 vacation days in the previous year, being legal holidays (pro-rata for part time employees), he/she may sell her remaining (above legal-) vacation days (or a part of them).

GAC maintain a list for these accounts in order to avoid deactivating these accounts during any cleanup process.\\n\\nWhile Idle User Clean-up activity, GAC need to double check 60-days idle user list and ensure that recentlycreated accounts for Acquisition projects are not cleaned up.\\n\\nIdle User Clean-up (Monthly):GAC will perform Idle User Cleanup activity on monthly basis, to deactivate the Jabber accounts of former employees and to free up the Jabber license. It is advised to do this clean up on the first working day of the month.\\n\\nBelow is the procedure to perform this cleanup.\\n\\n In the Cisco WebEx Messenger Administration Tool, go to “Report” tab. In the Report type choose the “Messenger activity report”. In the month and year drop down you may request which month report has to be generated and click on Generate report button. You may find the report available to download in “Report History”.\\n\\n To perform the Idle user cleanup, action part starts a month before the cleanup is scheduled. \\n\\nFirst month, last month messenger activity has to be in generated. For example, if you have planned to do the cleanup on October 1st, then on September 1st you need to get the August month’s messenger activity report. Name the report as “Activity Report YYYY-MM”, for example “Activity Report 2016-08”, and upload to specified GAC sharepoint folder.\\n\\nSecond month, on the day the cleanup is scheduled, pull the activity report of the previous month. For example, if you have planned to do the cleanup on October 1st, then on that day you need get the September month’s messenger activity report. Name the report as “Activity Report YYYY-MM”, for example “Activity Report 2016-09”, and upload to specified GAC sharepoint folder.\\n\\nIn both the reports, filter the BLANK values in the column “Last Login” (column L). This will get the list of users who have not logged in to their Jabber in that month.\\n\\nIdentify and pull out the usernames (email addresses) that are repeated in both the reports. These are users who haven’t used their Jabber for 60 days or more. Please note that this list will also have accounts that are already deactivated. Please exclude those deactivated accounts then generate 60-day idle user report. Name the report as “60-idle user list YYYY-MM”, for example “60-idle user list 2016-10”, and upload to specified GAC sharepoint folder.\\n\\nCalculate the license usage rate by using the number of activate users divide the number of user licenses purchased(Note: Normally, the number of user licenses purchased will not change. If the number changed, the service manager will provide the information to GAC). For example, if the number of activate users is 10290 and the number of user licenses purchased is 13800, the license usage rate is 10300/13800=74.64%. If the license usage rate < 97% then no clean up required. If the license usage rate >=97%, then follow the Deactivate User to delete the accounts of the idle users base on 60-idle user list.\\n\\nAfter deactivating the accounts, send notification to each deactivated idle user about the cleanup, let them know why we deactivate their Jabber account and how to reactivate their Jabber if they still need to use Jabber and how to avoid their Jabber be deactivate as idle account in the future.\\n\\nAttached is an example email sent out after deactivating the jabber account by idle user cleanup.\\n\\n Email Template:\\n\\n____________________________\\n\\nHello XXXX,\\n\\nWhat’s happening?\\n\\nLicense for the Cisco Jabber keeps growing rapidly. Due to this ABC Comp IT has to increase the license which subsequently increases the cost. In order to reduce the license cost and free up the license of Cisco Jabber, ABC Comp IT is disabling the Jabber accounts that are identified as IDLE for more than 60 DAYS.\\n\\nHow you are affected?\\n\\nWe found that your Jabber account associated with your email address venkata.seshumotapothul@non.ABC Comp.com is identified as the IDLE ACCOUNT and not used for more than 60 DAYS.

       " Document(page_content=\"Power Broker for Windows\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nBob Schwarz\\n\\n2/6/19 4:03 PM | Last Updated 3/31/20 5:14 PM\\n\\nPower Broker for Windows\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nABC Comp is using PowerBroker for Windows to help protect ABC Comp computers from unknown malware. Unknown malware might get past the anti-malware defense (Symantec Endpoint Protection SEP) and run. If allowed to run, malware leverages the user's elevated rights to infect the computer and possibly spread to other computers and servers across our network. PowerBroker can provide applications the rights they need to run and allow users to make changes to protected areas of the operating system while blocking malware from running thereby giving the users increased capabilities to manage their computer while reducing the likelihood of a malware infection.\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nPowerBroker for Windows provides flexible, policy-based privileged delegation capabilities for the Microsoft Windows environment. PowerBroker selectively elevates privileges for applications, software installs, system tasks, scripts, control panel applets, management functions, and other application and system operations. Additionally, PowerBroker for Windows provides Session Monitoring, Risk Compliance, and File Integrity Monitoring capabilities for granular tracking of privileged user activity across Windows’ desktop environments.\\n\\nLeast-Privilege Objec ves \\n\\nThe concept of least privilege states that asset users should have the lowest level of access privileges required to effectively conduct their jobs. However, many basic operating system, management, application and software functions (e.g., configuration utilities) require more than basic privileges. This traditionally requires the end user to possess elevated privileges in the form of an administrative username and password. PowerBroker for Windows mitigates the need to distribute and maintain administrative credentials – or reveal these credentials to end users at all.\\n\\nHow to know Power Broker is installed on a computer?\\n\\n1. Programs, Apps and Features or Add/Remove Programs:\\n1. Windows Explorer\\nRight click on an exe or msi\\nRun Elevated or Install Elevated will be an option\\n1. Files on C:\\\\\\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\BeyondTrust\\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\BeyondTrust\\n\\nIf you are deployed in enforcing mode please read below information.\\n\\nHow do you use Beyondtrust Powerbroker for Windows?\\n\\nThe IT team is monitoring the BeyondTrust event logs to identify applications and activities that require elevated privileges and if the team has already defined a policy for a specific application, that application will run elevated without user interaction or notification.\\n\\nTargeting Applications on Demand (Shell Rule) – this rule is available to every computer that is running Power Broker for Windows installed.\\n\\nThe Shell rule enables users to elevate a specified executable file, installer package, script, shortcut, or Control Panel item by using a right-click option on one of the supported file types and selecting Run Elevated for an executable file or Install Elevated for a Windows Installer (MSI) package.\\n\\nFor any issues and question you can reach the following persons based on the geographic location:\\n\\nEMEA and APAC\\n\\n Bogdan Patrascu – bogdan.patrascu@ABC Comp.com\\n\\nBob Schwarz - bob.schwarz@ABC Comp.com\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-559.docx'}),\n",

To use Cisco Jabber Softphone off-VPN, all ABC Comp Employees (excluding China and India) may need to follow the instruction as below for phone services to be activated. If you do not currently have Soft Phone Services in your mobile device, please follow the instructions to have your device setup: Instructions\\n\\nCisco Jabber Softphone service off-VPN will NOT be available to employees in China and India currently. Also, NKWs will not be able to utilize Cisco Jabber phone services if they are not in the office. Offsite usage via VPN (PAN) or without VPN will remain restricted.\\n\\nCisco Jabber Softphone off-VPN will work the same as your current use of Jabber Softphone while on the company network. In addition, you will now have the ability to make and receive internal and external calls on your Jabber Soft Phone anywhere, including any ABC Comp-approved device that you have loaded Jabber on (e.g. Windows PC, Mac OS, iPhone, Android, Tablet devices).\\n\\nImportant:  Connect to ABC Comp VPN or Wave WI-FI to allow your device to download an activation file from the Voice Call Manager system.\\n\\nLaunch Cisco Jabber like how you usually do - from your PC or from your mobile device.\\n\\nIf you successfully connect to Jabber Soft Phone off-VPN, the Phone Services option will be activated with no error message. Otherwise, you will see an error message – “Unable to connect” (PC) or “Cannot connect to Unified Communications Manager server. Check your network settings.” (Mobile).

When these messages are sent to a list they not only affect one person, but the entire list of subscribers. There are many ways to deal with spam and viruses at the list level so that you can prevent or limit them from reaching your users. The following options can only be set up by the list admin and may affect the way your list currently works.\\n\\nThe only lists that have real problems with spammers are Open lists, which are set up so that subscribers andnon-subscribers can post. Obviously, one way to prevent spammers from emailing your list is to make the list Closed. However, if you make the list closed then subscribers will only be able to send to the list with the email address that they are subscribed with. For example, if you are subscribed to the list with your ABC Comp email address, but when you are at home you send from your ISP (e.g. AOL, EarthLink) account, you may have problems. See How do I change my list from Open to Closed?\\n\\nUnfortunately, spam isn't the only type of message that you want to prevent from going to your subscribers.Viruses are also a major problem that is exacerbated by listservs. Setting up your list so that only members can post will help stop SPAM but viruses are spread by the subscribers. One remedy to this problem is to setup Moderation on your list. Moderation means that the Moderator, normally the admin, but can be multiple subscribers, must first approve messages before they are sent to all of the subscribers. If your list has very high traffic (ie. 10+ messages are sent per day) then moderation may not a good idea, otherwise the moderator will be busy all day approving/rejecting messages. See How do I setup my list for Moderation?\\n\\nInstead of changing the way your list operates you can also setup filters. This option is useful only if youknow what to filter. So, it's tough to filter for spam or viruses that you've never received. However, if the same virus or spam has been sent many times then a filter is a good idea.\\n\\nNote : If a filter is improperly setup it may filter legitimate mail, so be careful.\\n\\nSee How do I filter mail sent to my list? for instructions on Filtering.\\n\\n1/1\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-210.docx'}),\n",

This document is related to only ABC Comp Purchased Macs after December 2019. For general ADE setup instructions reference MAC-SID-100. \\n\\n2.0  DEFINITIONS\\n\\nAD – Active Directory\\n\\nADE - Automated Device Enrollment formerly known as DEP/Device Enrollment Program. This is a tool which provisions your Mac directly from Apple which automatically connects your Mac upon first boot. SID – Support Instruction Document\\n\\n3.0  REQUIREMENTS\\n\\n An ADE enabled Mac. Your Mac would have been purchased from a ABC Comp Vendor such as SHI via Cherwell. If your Mac was acquired from an unsupported vendor such as Best Buy or the physical Apple Store, this method will not work.\\n\\n Network Access. Setup will work anywhere in the world. If you are in a ABC Comp Office, connect to ks-guest WiFi during setup. However, DO NOT use wave during setup. If you are on home network, make sure internet is available.\\n\\n4.0  END-USER TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS\\n\\n4.1  Missing Remote Management Screen does not appear\\n\\nIf the Remote Management screen does not show up after you have connected to the internet. Follow these instructions:\\n\\n4.1.1 Go back to the Language Screen, the step before connecting to the internet. \\n\\n4.1.2   Launch Terminal, by pressing Control Option Command T on your keyboard. \\n\\n4.1.3  Type sudo profiles renew -type enrollment and press return.\\n\\n4.1.4 Quit Terminal, and return to MAC-SID-100 Section 4.1.3 to continue setup.\\n\\n4.1.5 If the Remote Management screen does not appear after taking these steps reach out pdl-macsupport@ABC Comp.com.\\n\\n4.2  Beginning Enrollment Screen does not appear\\n\\nIf the Beginning Enrollment Screen does not appear during setup (MAC-SID-100 Section 4.2.2) follow the following steps: \\n\\n4.2.1  Launch Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) 4.2.2  Run the command:\\n\\nsudo jamf policy\\n\\n4.2.3  Enter in your computer password, the cursor will not move, and press the return key.\\n\\n4.2.4  The Beginning Enrollment Screen should load after a few minutes. \\n\\n4.2.5  If the error message:\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/26/2020\\n\\nDevice Signature Error - A valid device signature is required to perform the action.\\n\\nappears. Do not advance contact the support desk for assistance. \\n\\n4.3  Setup Screen Freezes at Step 2 of 6 while installing applications\\n\\nThis occurs as a result of a bad/poor internet connection. We have seen users that connect to Wave be a general offender of this during setup, which is why it is recommended not to use Wave during setup. To resolve:\\n\\n4.3.1  Hard Reboot (Press and hold the Touch ID/Power Button) the computer.\\n\\n4.3.2  Connect to a known good network, if you were having issues with the ABC Comp Network, it is recommended to resume setup from your home network. \\n\\n4.3.3  Launch Self Service (/Applications/Self Service.app).\\n\\n4.3.4  Click on Finish Setup. Your Setup should resume normally and complete as expected.\\n\\n4.3.5  Microsoft Office will start to install in the background, once it is completed you will see the icons displayed on your dock. While waiting for this to be completed, you may use the web version of Office.\\n\\n4.3.6  You will see a Notification from Enterprise Connect, click on Setup Now. Make sure there is no red circle status beside Domain. Enter your ABC Comp password and click Sign In.\\n\\n5.0  SUPPORT DESK INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\n5.1  Device Signature Error\\n\\nWhen running the command sudo jamf policy in terminal this error message is provided. This occurs as a result of a corrupted MDM certificate, usually the result of a poor internet connection. You must have Jamf Admin enrollment privileges to complete this support request. If you do not have proper credentials then assign the ticket to someone with the correct credentials or to send an escalation to pdl-macsupport@ABC Comp.com to resolve:\\n\\n5.1.1  Launch Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) 5.1.2  Run the command:\\n\\nsudo jamf enroll-prompt\\n\\n5.1.3  Enter YOUR AD credentials into the JSS Username/Password fields and SSH Username/Password fields. Do NOT enter the end-user’s credentials as the re-enrollment will fail. The computer will still register correctly to the end-user.\\n\\n5.1.4  From this point the computer will attempt to enroll into jamf. The setup should run normally from this point and the user can complete setup by continuing on MAC-SID-100 Section 4.2.\\n\\n2/2', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-439.docx'}),\n",

ABC Comp users need to be aware of these limits and adjust your mail usage accordingly to adhere to the limits.\\n\\nAddress book limits\\n\\n Mailbox storage limits\\n\\n Capacity alerts\\n\\n Mailbox folder limits\\n\\n Message limits\\n\\n Receiving and sending limits\\n\\n Retention limits\\n\\n Distribution group limits\\n\\n Exchange ActiveSync limits\\n\\nAddress Book Limits\\n\\n Address list limit The maximum number of address lists that can be created in an Exchange Online or Exchange Server 2013 organization. This number includes the default address lists in Exchange Online, such as All Contacts and All Groups. \\n\\nOffline address book limit The maximum number of offline address books (OAB) that can be created in an Exchange Online or Exchange Server 2013 organization.  \\n\\nAddress book policies limit The maximum number of address book policies (ABP) that be created in an Exchange Online or Exchange Server 2013 organization. \\n\\nGlobal address lists The maximum number of global address lists (GAL) that be created in an Exchange Online or Exchange Server 2013 organization. \\n\\nMailbox storage limits\\n\\nThe amount of mailbox storage available is determined by the mailbox type and ABC Comp’s subscription license.\\n\\nCapacity Alerts\\n\\nExchange Online provides three kinds of notifications when a user’s mailbox is nearing, or at, capacity:\\n\\nWarning   The user receives an email warning that the mailbox is approaching the maximum size limit.\\n\\nThis warning is intended to encourage users to delete unwanted mail. \\n\\nProhibit Send   The user receives a prohibit-send notification email when the mailbox size limit is reached. The user cannot send new messages until enough email is deleted to bring the mailbox below the size limit. \\n\\n Prohibit Send/Receive   Exchange Online rejects any incoming mail when the mailbox size limit is reached, and sends a non-delivery report (NDR) to the sender. The sender has the option to try resending the mail later. To receive messages again, the user must delete email until the mailbox is below the size limit.  \\n\\nMailbox folder limits\\n\\nThese limits are intended to limit mailboxes to known dimensions that can be supported in Exchange Online. The goal of these limits is to prevent an infinite number of mailbox items per folder, an infinite number of folders per mailbox, or an infinite number of public folders per Exchange Online organization. For practical purposes, mailbox folder limits are in effect unlimited and sufficient to support most Exchange Online mailboxes and on-premises mailboxes that are migrated to Exchange Online.\\n\\nMaximum number of messages per mailbox folder   Specifies the maximum number of messages for a mailbox folder. New messages can’t be delivered or saved to a folder when this limit is reached. \\n\\nWarning for number of messages per mailbox folder   Specifies the number of messages that a mailbox folder can hold before Exchange Online sends a warning message to the mailbox owner. When this quota is reached, warning messages are sent once a day. \\n\\n Maximum number of messages per folder in the Recoverable Items folder   Specifies the maximum number of messages that can be contained in each folder in the Recoverable Items folder. When a folder exceeds this limit, it can’t store new messages. For example, if the Deletions folder in the Recoverable Items folder has exceeded the message count limit and the mailbox owner attempts to permanently delete items from their mailbox, the deletion will fail. \\n\\n Warning for number of messages per folder in the Recoverable Items folder   Specifies the number of messages that each folder in the Recoverable Items folder can hold before Exchange Online logs an event to the application event log. \\n\\n Maximum number of subfolders per mailbox folder   Specifies the maximum number of subfolders that can be created in a mailbox folder. The mailbox owner won’t be able to create a new subfolder when this limit is reached. \\n\\n Warning for number of subfolders per mailbox folder   Specifies the number of subfolders that can be created in a mailbox folder before Exchange Online sends a warning message to the mailbox owner. When this quota is reached, warning messages are sent once a day. \\n\\n Maximum folder hierarchy depth   Specifies the maximum number of levels in the folder hierarchy of a mailbox. The mailbox owner won’t be able to create another level in the folder hierarchy of the mailbox folder when this limit is reached. \\n\\n Warning for folder hierarchy depth   Specifies the number of levels in the folder hierarchy of a mailbox folder that can be created before Exchange Online sends a warning message to the mailbox owner. When this quota is reached, warning messages are sent once a day. \\n\\n Maximum number of public folders   Specifies the maximum number of public folders in the complete public folder hierarchy. When this limit is reached, existing public folders must be deleted before new public folders can be created. \\n\\n Maximum number of subfolders per public folder   Specifies the maximum number of subfolders that can be created in a public folder. New subfolders can’t be created in a public folder when this limit is reached. \\n\\n Warning for number of subfolders per public folder   Specifies the number of subfolders that can be created in a public folder before Exchange Online sends a warning message to the folder owner. If no owner exists, warning messages are sent to users with Owner permissions. When this quota is reached, warning messages are sent once a day. \\n\\nFeature\\tABC Comp\\n\\nMaximum number of messages per mailbox folder\\t1 million Warning for number of messages per mailbox folder\\t900,000\\n\\nMaximum number of messages per folder in the Recoverable Items folder\\t3 million\\n\\nStorage quota for Recoverable Items folder in primary mailbox (not on hold)30 GB\\n\\nStorage quota for Recoverable Items folder in primary mailbox (on hold)\\t100 GB\\n\\nStorage quota for Recoverable Items folder in archive mailbox (not on hold) Unlimited Storage quota for Recoverable Items folder in archive mailbox (on hold)\\tUnlimited\\n\\nWarning for number of messages per folder in the Recoverable Items folder 2.75 million\\n\\nMaximum number of subfolders per mailbox folder\\t10,000\\n\\nWarning for number of subfolders per mailbox folder\\t9000\\n\\nMaximum folder hierarchy depth\\t300 Warning for folder hierarchy depth\\t250\\n\\nMaximum number of public folders\\t100,000\\n\\nMaximum number of subfolders per public folder\\t10,000 Warning for number of subfolders per public folder\\t9000\\n\\nMessage Limits\\n\\nThe following limits are applied to every email message.\\n\\n Message size limit   Message size limits are necessary to prevent large messages from blocking delivery of other messages and affecting service performance for all users. These limits include attachments, and apply organization-wide to all messages (inbound, outbound, and internal). Messages larger than this limit will not be delivered, and the sender will receive a non-delivery report (NDR).  \\n\\nSubject length limit   The maximum number of text characters allowed in the subject line of an email message. \\n\\nFile attachments limit   The maximum number of file attachments allowed in an email message. Even if the total size of all the file attachments doesn't violate the message size limit, there is still a limit on how many attachments are allowed in the message. This limit is controlled by the multipart message limit. \\n\\nFile attachment size limit   The maximum file size of a single attachment. \\n\\nMultipart message limit   The maximum number of message body parts that are allowed in a MIME multipart message. This limit also controls the maximum number of file attachments that are allowed in a message. \\n\\n Embedded message depth limit   The maximum number of forwarded email messages that are allowed in an email message. \\n\\nFeature\\tABC Comp\\n\\nMessage size limit - Outlook\\t150 MB\\n\\nMessage size limit – OWA\\t112 MB\\n\\nMessage size limit - Outlook for Mac\\t35 MB\\n\\nMessage size limit – migration\\t150 MB\\n\\nSubject length limit\\t255 characters\\n\\nFile attachments limit\\t250 attachments\\n\\nFile attachment size limit – Outlook\\t150 MB\\n\\nFile attachment size limit – OWA\\t35 MB\\n\\nFile attachment size limit - Outlook for Mac\\t35 MB\\n\\nMultipart message limit\\t250 parts\\n\\nEmbedded message depth limit\\t30 embedded messages\\n\\nReceiving and sending limits\\n\\nReceiving and sending limits are applied to combat spam and mass-mailing worms or viruses. These limits help to protect the health of our systems and keep our users safe.\\n\\nReceiving limits\\n\\nReceiving limits apply to the number of messages that a user, group, or public folder can receive per hour. This applies for both messages received from the Internet and from on-premises servers. When the receiving limit has been exceeded, any emails sent to that mailbox will receive a non-delivery report stating that the mailbox has exceeded the maximum delivery threshold. After one hour, the limit will refresh and the mailbox will once again be able to receive messages.\\n\\nSending limits\\n\\nSending limits apply to the number of recipients, number of messages, and number of recipients per message that a user can send from their Exchange Online account.\\n\\nNote. For distribution groups stored in an organization's address book, the group is counted as one recipient. For distribution groups stored in the Contacts folder of a mailbox, the members of the group are counted individually.\\n\\n Recipient rate limit   To discourage the delivery of unsolicited bulk messages, Exchange Online has recipient limits that prevent users and applications from sending large volumes of email. These limits are applied per-user to all outbound and internal messages. \\n\\nRecipient limit   This is the maximum number of recipients allowed in the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields for a single email message. \\n\\nMessage rate limit   Message rate limits determine how many messages a user can send from their Exchange Online account within a specified period of time. This limit helps prevent overconsumption of system resources by a single sender. If a user submits messages at a rate that exceeds the limit via SMTP client submission, the messages will be rejected and the client will need to retry. \\n\\nFeature\\tABC Comp\\n\\nRecipient rate limit\\t10,000 recipients per day\\n\\nRecipient limit\\t500 recipients\\n\\nRecipient proxy address limit\\t400\\n\\nMessage rate limit (SMTP client submission only)\\t30 messages per minute\\n\\nRetention limits\\n\\nThese limits control the length of time that items in specific folders in the Inbox can be accessed.\\n\\n Deleted Items folder retention period   The maximum number of days that items can remain in the Deleted Items folder before they’re automatically removed. \\n\\nRetention period for items removed from the Deleted Items folder   The maximum numbers of days that items removed from the Deleted Items folder are retained before they’re permanently deleted. Junk Email folder retention period   The maximum number of days that items can remain in the Junk Email folder before they’re automatically removed. \\n\\nFeature\\tABC Comp\\n\\nDeleted Items folder retention period\\tNo limit\\n\\nRetention period for items removed from the Deleted Items folder\\t14 days\\n\\nJunk Email folder retention period\\t30 days\\n\\nDistribution group limits\\n\\nThese limits apply to distribution groups in your organization's shared address book.\\n\\nMaximum number of distribution group members   The total recipient count is determined after distribution group expansion. \\n\\nLimit sending messages to large distribution groups   Distribution groups that contain the number of members specified by this limit must have delivery management or message approval options configured. Delivery management specifies a list of senders who are allowed to send messages to the distribution group. Message approval specifies one or more moderators who must approve all messages sent to the distribution group. \\n\\n Maximum message size for large distribution groups   If a message is sent to 5,000 or more recipients, the message size can't exceed this limit. If the message size exceeds the limit, the message isn't delivered, and the sender receives a non-delivery report (NDR). The total recipient count is determined after distribution group expansion. \\n\\nFeature\\tABC Comp\\n\\nMaximum number of distribution group members\\t100,000 members\\n\\nLimit sending messages to large distribution group\\t5,000 or more members\\n\\nMaximum message size for large distribution groups\\t2 MB\\n\\nMaximum number of distribution group owners\\t10\\n\\nMaximum number of groups a user can create\\t300,000\\n\\nExchange ActiveSync limits\\n\\nThe following limits apply to Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, a client protocol that synchronizes mailbox data between mobile devices and Exchange.\\n\\n Exchange ActiveSync device limit   The maximum number of Exchange ActiveSync devices per mailbox. \\n\\n Exchange ActiveSync file attachment limit   The maximum size of a message file attachment that can be sent or received by an Exchange ActiveSync device.  \\n\\nSource : Microsoft Technet\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-634.docx'}),\n",

How do I determine if I can use it with the SafeNet Authentication Client solution?\\n\\nI have forgotten my passcode to access the certificate on the fob/token and now cannot connect to the VPN.  What do I do to restore my VPN access?\\n\\nI have a SafeNet eToken 5110 with an expiring or no VPN certificate on it. How do I install a valid token VPN certificate?\\n\\nQ. I have an old Symantec USB fob/token that was used with the previous Symantec VPN solution.  How do I determine if I can use it with the SafeNet Authentication Client solution?\\n\\nA. Please open the SafeNet Authentication Client installed on your PC, plug in the USB fob and select it under 'Tokens'.  Please look at the Product Name description (refer to snip below).  If the Product Name is SafeNet eToken 5110, your USB token is compatible with this solution.  If you do not have a 5110 token, please send an email to mpki-admin@ABC Comp.com for assistance.\\n\\nQ. I have forgotten my passcode to access the certificate on the fob/token and now cannot connect to the VPN. How do I restore my VPN access?\\n\\nA. First, you need to initialize the token so you can reset the passcode.  Please note this action will delete all content from the token, including any existing certificates.  After resetting your passcode, you will need to either open a Help Desk ticket requesting an 'Employee Emergency Certificate' to temporarily connect and then install the token certificate or use a colleague's VPN session to launch certmgr.msc under your primary NT account so you can install a new VPN token certificate.\\n\\nSteps to initialize your fob/token:\\n\\nMake sure USB fob is plugged into the PC and any USB driver installations have finished before proceeding\\n\\nOpen the SAC client\\n\\nStart-->SafeNet-->SafeNet Authentical Client Tools\\n\\nClick on the ‘Initialize’ button \\n\\nSelect ‘Configure all initialization settings and policies’\\n\\nClick ‘Next’\\n\\nYou can change the token name on this screen if you desire, leave all other settings unchanged Click ‘Finish’\\n\\n  Select ‘OK’ at the Warning screen\\n\\n You will receive a confirmation message the initialization was successful\\n\\nQ. I have a SafeNet eToken 5110 with an expiring or no VPN certificate on it. How do I install a valid token VPN certificate?\\n\\nA. Please follow the instructions below to install a fob/token certificate onto your 5110 token:\\n\\nWhile logged into the shared/generic account that is connected to the ABC Comp network:\\n\\nLocate and run certmgr.msc as a different user providing your primary ABC Comp credentials (not the shared account) to manually request the new fob certificate currently named Test-ABC Comp PIV Smartcard\\n\\nKSP\\n\\nRight click on Personal-->Certificates folder and select New Tasks-->Request New Certificate Click 'Next' twice\\n\\nSelect the Test-ABC Comp PIV Smartcard KSP option\\n\\nClick 'Enroll'\\n\\n You will be prompted for the token/fob passcode in order to enroll for the certificate.  If this is the first enrollment you have performed on this token or you have just initialized the token, you will need to enter the default passcode.  The default passcode set during the token initialization is 1234567890. \\n\\nClick 'OK'\\n\\nIf prompted to change your passcode, please follow the instructions below to complete this step. Your new passcode must consist of 6-16 characters that contains Upper, Lower, Numbers and special characters.\\n\\n Click 'OK' and provide a new passcode that meets the length and complexity requirements mentioned above.\\n\\nEnter the default passcode of 1234567890 as the Current passcode and enter your new, unique passcode twice per the screenshot above.  Click 'OK' when done.\\n\\nYou will see a confirmation message that your passcode change was successful.  If you receive a message indicating the change was not successful, please ensure your selected passcode meets the requirements mentioned above.  Click 'OK'.\\n\\n Next, you should see the certificate enrollment succeeded window as the snip below demonstrates:\\n\\n If the enrollment fails, please send an email to mpki-admin@ABC Comp.com or open an IT Help Desk ticket for quicker response.\", metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-902.docx'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"6/26/2020\\n\\nHow to Configure Third-Party App Email for DMARC Compliance\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nShirley Sim\\n\\n2/8/19 10:59 PM | Last Updated 2/8/19 11:28 PM\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nDomain-based Message Authentication and Conformance, or DMARC, is an email validation system designed to detect and prevent email spoofing. It is a standard for authenticating mail sent by a third party that uses a ABC Comp domain or sub-domain. The purpose of implementing DMARC standards is to ensure messages sent using ABC Comp's domain name are coming from authorized senders. This will reduce, and possibly eliminate, phishing attacks that make use of fraudulent email addresses that appear to be coming from ABC Comp by using ABC Comp.com, or a subdomain such as non.ABC Comp.com. To ensure that our outbound email messages sent by third-party hosted apps used and owned by ABC Comp are coming from senders we have authorized, ABC Comp has implemented DMARC standards on apps across IT and the business.\\n\\nTo find out more about DMARC, visit its service page here.\\n\\nRemediation Eligibility \\n\\nAn application you own or manage is eligible for remediation if it meets both of the criteria below:  \\n\\nThe application is hosted externally, and not inside ABC Comp’s Network (e.g. externally hosted, cloudbased applications), AND\\n\\nThe application is sending email using the ABC Comp domain (ABC Comp.com) or a ABC Comp subdomain (e.g. conferencing.ABC Comp.com).\\n\\nGeneral Instructions \\n\\nConfirm an app is eligible for remediation by verifying it meets both of the criteria described above.\\n\\nContact support for the app and get the SPF and/or DKIM records, only one is required, but it's better to have both.\\n\\nFill up and submit your request with information relating to the app to be authorized to send messages as ABC Comp. The O365 Email Support team will reach out to you and work with you to get your app configured to meet DMARC standards.\\n\\nProvide the resource from the O365 Email Support Team with the SPF and/or DKIM record obtained from the app's support team.\\n\\nABC Comp IT O365 Email Support team will make the necessary DNS updates.

By utilizing state-of-the-art software- and device-layer encryption to protect the data stored on your drives and monitoring your computer’s startup settings, BitLocker prevents unauthorized personnel from being able to exploit vulnerabilities or access your encrypted information, even if physically moving your hard drive from one computer to another.\\n\\nUntil May 2018 ABC Comp had used Symantec PGP Encryption exclusively drive encryption solution.

The total overtime worked per day must amount to more than half an hour for the employee to be eligible for overtime compensation. Any time worked over that half an hour is rounded off to quarters. When determining the number of overtime hours, a lunch break of at least half an hour should be taken into account. Where external duty employees are concerned, the following is regarded as overtime: the time between leaving home until the moment of arriving at home. By default, 1 hour traveling time is deducted. When determining the number of overtime hours, here too the rules as to lunch and dinner breaks apply.  \\n\\nEligibility\\n\\nIn order to be eligible for overtime compensation, your annual salary should not exceed the limit mentioned under Variables.

The majority of email messages are safe in that anti-malware engines are able to detect that their content does not include anything that could damage the recipient. But because malware authors constantly alter their attack techniques in an attempt to bypass anti-malware blocks, the danger exists that items might contain something that is dangerous but cannot be detected because the attack vector has never been seen before. This content might belong to a so-called Day Zero attack.\\n\\nMessages and attachments that do not have a known malware signature are deemed unsafe. O365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) routes these messages to a special hypervisor environment where a variety of techniques are used to test the content. If everything checks out, ATP releases the item back to the Exchange transport system for delivery to the end user.\\n\\nNow, ATP provides the option to scan inbound attachments dynamically and allow users access to message bodies while the scan proceeds. This feature is called Dynamic Delivery. Dynamic Delivery recognizes that, in most cases, unrecognized content lurks in attachments rather than the messages to which they are attached. If a message is OK, it is possible to deliver it immediately. Meantime, the attachment is shuttled off to the side to be checked and when everything checks out, the attachment is released to reconstitute the full message.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, recipients get to see the safe part of a message immediately instead of having to wait for O365 to validate the entire content. And often it is enough for a recipient to see the text of a message to understand its importance and know if they must take action.\\n\\nDynamic Delivery has been enabled for all ABC Comp users migrated to O365 on Friday 21 July 2017.\\n\\n\\nThings to Note & Best Practices\\n\\nEnabling of Dynamic Delivery does not eradicate mail delivery delay issue; but lets you know that a file attachment in the message is waiting to completeits scanning by ATP for malware detection.\\n\\nIf you have an Outlook rule which automatically moves any or all email received in the Inbox to a Personal Folder (.PST) on your local hard disk, this cancause an issue with O365 being unable to deliver the attachment into the original message when ATP scanning is completed as the system is unable to locate where the message has been moved to. However, moving the message from Inbox to any subfolder within your O365 mailbox is not an issue.\\n\\nEither, disable the rule or you will need to forward the message you received to yourself to force the attachments to be released to you. Unfortunately, if you have moved the message out of your Inbox or mailbox, it is not possible to release the attachment to you.\\n\\nInstead of attaching file attachments to your email messages, consider sharing links and URLs with your email audience to those file attachments that youcan store in your One Drive or SharePoint Online document management tools.', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-667.docx'}),\n",

Re-imaging the machine will erase all saved data!\\n\\nMake sure all wanted software licenses and keys are available, as you will need to reinstall whatever wanted software back onto the machine once the process is complete\\n\\nClose all applications and restart your machine. \\n\\nWhen the grey screen appears hold down the ‘Command’ + ‘R’ key for 10 seconds and wait for the boot process. A language menu will come up. Select the language that you want and hit ‘continue’\\n\\nIn the next (system utility) window, select ‘Disk Utility’ and then ‘continue’.\\n\\nIn the next window select the volume ‘Macintosh HD’ in the left window and then go to the ‘Erase’ tab in the right side menu.\\n\\nSelect Format : Mac OS Extended (Journal)\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/26/2020\\n\\nMac OS Extended is recommended for the format. Then select erase for the volume. This process should take a few minutes depending on the amount of data you have.\\n\\nOnce this is done. Return to the system utility menu, select ‘Reinstall Mac OS X’ and 7. Follow the steps. That’s it! \\n\\n2/2', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-665.docx'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Wired Network Authentication Troubleshooting for ABC Comp-managed Macs\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nChow, Shiang Yong\\n\\n5/14/19 12:44 PM | Last Updated 7/25/19 9:06 PM\\n\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nAll users should start seeing their wired network authentication with EAP-TLS, which means authenticated with user certificate. Your Mac should automatically connect with this authentication method if you have a user certificate installed. However, even if your network connection is not authenticated with EAP-TLS, you will still continue to get full network connection. This change is to get ready for future network project implementation.\\n\\nNote: for Local account user, you will not be able to authenticate with your user certificate because user certificate is tied to NT account. ABC Comp IT requires every Mac users to login with to their NT account for work purposes.\\n\\nThis article is created assuming end users are logged in with ABC Comp NT account.\\n\\nHow to Check if Wired Network Authentication is Correct:\\n\\nGo to System Preference > Network >  Select the Ethernet Adapter, you should see \"Authentication via EAP-\\n\\nTLS\" \\n\\nThis will be the correct and expected behaviour.\\n\\nThere would be cases where your wired connection is not authenticated with EAP-TLS. Below are some of the steps to get this corrected.\\n\\nSymptom and Solution:\\n\\nNo connection to the wired network\\n\\nIf you plugged in the network cable and waited for over a minute but the connection status is YELLOW and showing ’Self Assigned IP’ with the IP address of 169.x.x.x, your wired network is not connected properly.\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nOn the same screen, Click on the \"Advanced..\" button\\n\\nGo to 802.1X tab, uncheck “enable automatic connection”. Hit OK and Apply. Replug in wired network and wait for a minute, it should get you onto the network.\\n\\nYou will still need to connect with EAP-TLS authentication. Please follow the next instructions to get it fixed. \\n\\nConnected but authentication not showing EAP-TLS\\n\\nIf you plugged in the network cable, gets an IP and status shows green, BUT the authentication method is NOT\\n\\nEAP-TLS\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nGo to Finder > Applications Folder > Utilities Folder > Keychain Access.app. Locate your User certificate which is similar to your AD account name with two year validity.\\n\\nIf your user certificate is missing, please follow this link to reinstall.  https://zero.comaround.com/link/6b3f3fdc2aba454892fb4cdd9b4b382f/\\n\\nOnce your cert is available, go to System Preferences > Network >  Select their Ethernet Adapter interface > Advance > 802.1X, make sure “enable automatic connection” option is checked. Hit OK and Apply.\\n\\nReplug in the network cable and it should now connect with EAP-TLS.\\n\\nContact pdl-mac-support@ABC Comp.com if you continue to have issues', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-958.docx'}),\n",

Outlook and other email clients used within ABC Comp make it very easy to construct such a group that you may create and modify at will. This will allow you to send information to any group of individuals easily; however, it will not allow them to send mail among themselves easily.\\n\\nIf, however, your goal is to better facilitate communication back and forth among a group of people -- e.g. a workgroup, a committee, or a special interest group - you may wish to set up a list. A list is an e-mail address that distributes mail to all members of a specified group. A list enables members to communicate with or reply to the whole group without typing a lengthy list of email addresses each time. The ability to include external email addresses (and not only ABC Comp.com or non.ABC Comp.com) and also for lists members to subscribe/unsubscribe (opt-in/opt-out) from the mailing lists makes it a good alternate option to the Public Distribution Lists (or mail-enabled groups) through Outlook/Exchange.\\n\\nPerforming List Functions\\n\\nThere are several different types of software to manage lists. The software ABC Comp uses to manage lists is called Lyris from Lyris Technologies, Inc. If you are only adding or maintaining a distribution list containing ABC Comp Exchange E-mail Addresses, you may consider using the Public Distribution List (PDL).\\n\\nThe facilities and commands described in this document are for managing lists using Lyris. Lyris has a very rich set of commands that allow you to configure your list in many different ways. This document only describes what we feel are the most common and useful commands for managing your lists.

It is effectively a \"light\" version of Outlook, allowing you to send, receive, read, delete and reply to emails via a web browser.\\n\\nNOTE: When using a Primary PC on the ABC Comp network, the Outlook client is still the recommended tool for users to access to their corporate E- mail.\\n\\nYou can access your corporate email via OWA from within the ABC Comp network while you are in the office or out of the office. When you are out of the office, you will not be required to connect through a Remote Access VPN solution (Cisco AnyConnect or Global Protect) to access to e-mail, but will use ADFS and Multifactor authentication (MFA). When you are connected to VPN from external network, you will bypass MFA.\\n\\nNOTE: If you are planning to concurrently access e-mail and other enterprise applications that are not externally available off the ABC Comp network, then you will still need to first connect to VPN.\\n\\nTo access OWA through internet without having to authenticate via Virtual Private Network (VPN):\\n\\nFrom your Internet Browser, go to ABC Comp Outlook Web App website: https://outlook.office.com/\\n\\nAuthenticate as required:\\n\\nIf within the ABC Comp network, authenticate with your AD credentials.\\n\\nIf outside the ABC Comp network, authenticate with AD credentials and pass MFA.\\n\\n1. Begin using OWA.\\n\\nSecurity Recommendation: To help ensure the security of ABC Comp information, when you use a public PC, please make sure you exit out of the browser and delete any files that you saved to the local PC/Desktop.\\n\\nRelated Resources:\\n\\nWebEx Productivity Tools allow for easy WebEx integration with the MS Outlook calendar. However, the WebEx Productivity Tools DO NOT\\n\\ndirectly integrate with OWA. As a workaround, any meeting invitations created within OWA that utilize WebEx should follow these instructions:\\n\\nOpen https://keysight.webex.com\\n\\nClick the Log In button in the top right corner.\\n\\nAuthenticate using your WebEx username and password.\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/26/2020\\n\\nCopy the Personal Room URL link provided on the Meeting Center tab and paste that URL into the meeting invitation within OWA\\n\\n2/2', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-603.docx'}),\n",

You will have to enter your old password and then the new one (twice). Click Update to save the new password. If you are locked out of your account or cannot remember your password, you can reset your password by going to www.echosign.com, and clicking the ‘I forgot my password link’ just under the log in fields. This will prompt Echo Sign to send you an email with a link to change your password.\\n\\nFAQ's\\n\\n How do I upload an image of my pen-and-paper signature to use as my e-signature?\\n\\nTo upload an image of your handwritten signature, go to the Account tab and select Personal Preferences > My Signature. From there you have the option to either create a signature or initial by drawing it with your mouse or by uploading an image. To upload your signature to Echo Sign, you must first scan it into your computer to get an image of the signature.

Every message sent to the list is first routed to your email address for your approval. Moderated mailing lists are set up using the Lyris web interface. Lists are typically set up this way to prevent unsolicited mail from being delivered to all subscribers. You will be acting as a email filter for the list members.\\n\\nMaking Your List A Moderated one\\n\\nFirst you need to enter the Edit Mailing List page:\\n\\nAccess the ListManager Administrator Interface link on the List Service service catalog When prompted, enter your list admin email address and password.\\n\\nSee if the value is set to be the list you want to manage. If it is not, click that list name for a list of other lists that you administer, and choose the appropriate list.\\n\\nClick the Utilities tab, choose List Settings, then Email Submitted Content, and finally the Approval tab.\\n\\nActivating Moderation\\n\\nUnder Lyris you have three types of moderation:\\n\\nNot moderated -- no messages ever need approval\\n\\nModerated -- all messages require approval\\n\\nNumber Moderated -- members have a set number of postings moderated\\n\\nApproval Numbers (Approval # for number moderated)\\n\\nIf you set your list as \"Not Moderated\" the approval numbers should be set at \"0 No approvals needed.\"\\n\\nIf your list is set as \"Moderated\" your approval should be set at \"Always Needs Approval.\"\\n\\nIf your list is set as \"Number Moderated\" you will need to specify the number of messages new members will need approved before they will no longer be moderated (options range from 1 message to 100). You can also set an approval number for a specific list member on the Members page.\\n\\nYou go on vacation, but the list stays at work\\n\\nIf your list is moderated, you should make plans for when you\\'re not around to maintain the list. One option is to send a message to the list announcing that the list will \"close up shop\" until you return. But if you want the list to continue in your absence (and most people do), you have a few options. Let the mail pile up, or change the list to unmoderated, or find someone else to be the temporary moderator.\\n\\nAssigning a Substitute Moderator\\n\\nTo find someone else to be the temporary moderator,\\n\\n Go to the Members page of your list (login in to your list, click Members)\\n\\n1/2\\n\\n6/25/2020\\n\\nOnce on the Members page, locate the list member you want to be your temporary moderator and click on the address to get to the Edit Member section.\\n\\nClick the List Admin tab and set Receive moderation notifications to yes.\\n\\nClick Save at the bottom of the screen.\\n\\n2/2', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-143.docx'}),\n",

The hiring manager should appoint a internship mentor who will have sufficient time to guide and coach the intern. \\n\\nFurthermore the manager needs to have a verbal or written approval from the Business HR manager that the internship is approved. Then the manager is responsible to enter the request in SuccessFactors. \\n\\nAfter the request has been approved, the manager is responsible to send all information on the internship to the applicable internshipdepartments of the applicable education institutes or universities. Candidates are requested to apply via the website. Then the external recruitment agency, who will be informed via the web application, will select candidates. \\n\\nThen the hiring manager will, together with the internship mentor, plan and conduct the interviews. When a candidate is selected he/she will be informed by the manager. The level of the internship compensation needs to be agreed on with HR. The manager needs to inform the external recruitment agency on the final choice of candidate and the compensation. The external recruitment agency will then have a contract made up by ABC Comp Staffing. \\n\\nFinally the manager will have an appointment with the candidate to sign the agreement and answer possible questions. \\n\\nOnce the agreement is signed the manager can take the proper steps to make sure that the intern can get started on his/her first day (refer to SuccessFactors/Hire/Contract)\\n\\n1/1', metadata={'source': 'data/Sample Test/Banking KA/Knowledge Base/U-Article-392.docx'}),\n",

This Network Recording Player also allows for the .ARF files to be converted to other formats e.g. MP4 (MPEG-4), WMV (Windows Media) or SWF (Flash).\\n\\nFollow the steps below on how to convert a recorded WebEx meeting into a .MP4 file format.\\n\\nNote: Only the meeting host can download the file in WebEx. In addition, the options for downloading recording files are available only if a WebEx administrator has turned on the administration option for downloading recording files. The conversion of a Webex recording to Windows Media Format or Flash-format (ARF only) requires a Windows-based application. Webex recordings can be played back on a Mac, but they cannot be converted on a Mac. Step 1 - Export .ARF file from WebEx\\n\\nGo to My WebEx > My Files > My Recordings.\\n\\nDo one of the following (A or B):\\n\\nA). Select the recording from the My Recordings page. From the recording, select More, and select Download.\\n\\nB). Select the recording topic name in the recording list. On the Recording Information page that appears, select the link in the Download recording link field\\n\\nThe file will be saved in a .ARF (advanced recording file) file format, which is a WebEx specific video format. The file will be downloaded locally at the extension selected during the download process. \\n\\nStep 2 - Install the WebEx Network Recording Player\\n\\nNote: This is usually done via the WebEx site. \\n\\nLogin to https://keysight.webex.com using your ABC Comp WebEx account name and password\\n\\nNavigate to Webex Meetings | Support | Downloads\\n\\nUnder Recording and Playback, download the Webex Player and Network Recording Player accordingly depending on whether you are using a Windows or Mac client.\\n\\nOnce installation is completed, launch the Network Recording Player from Start | Programs | Network Recording Player.\\n\\nIf you have downloaded from https://Keysight.webex.com you will have the latest version (32.15.10)  installed on your PC.\\n\\nDownload the Network Recording Player installer here Step 3 - Convert .ARF file to .MP4 \\n\\nOpen the .ARF file with the WebEx ARF Player program. The recording will being playing immediately. Click the Pause button to pause playback.\\n\\nGo to the File menu, select Convert Format and then select .MP4.\\n\\nThe conversion dialog box will appear and allow an output filename to be specified. Select immediate conversion, and click OK to begin conversion. A dialog box will appear when the conversion is complete. Depending on the size of your file, the conversion process may take minutes to hours.\\n\\nOnce the file conversion is complete, the .MP4 will be available while the original .ARF file is retained.\\n\\nHowever, if the conversion wizard did not appear, you may encounter the following errors:\\n\\nPrompted to enter URL, account name and password when trying to convert an NBR to .MP4 format but information you supplied is not accepted Unable to convert an .ARF file to .MP4.\\n\\nError: 'Cannot install conversion tool. Contact your site administrator.' Prompted to log in when converting from .ARF to .MP4.\\n\\nError: 'Your Webex service site does not support converting Webex recordings to MP4 format.'
